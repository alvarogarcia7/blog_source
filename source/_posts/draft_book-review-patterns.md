During book reviews:
  * Do not focus only on what it's written. Also focus on what it is not written (i.e., what is omitted)
  * You need to test every single code snippet. TODO better explain the analogy with a QA role
  * The short and long distance: mark / fix short distance errors: spelling, grammar, disconnected ideas, etc but also the long distance errors: this chapter is not complete, not easy to understand, take the reader's place and try to remove your own knowledge (so you can understand what the author wanted to say, not what you think the author wanted to)
  * Be kind to the coder but not to the code (from Egoless programming). A book and a piece of code are the result of the same idea: authoring
  * Strive for perfection, at least yours: take any (technical) book that you like as an example. In this case, [Implementation patterns](http://www.amazon.com/Implementation-Patterns-Kent-Beck/dp/0321413091) by Kent Beck is my example: each sentence is well thought and condensed. There is almost no superfluous information. Everything is there for a reason.
  * Add your ideas: at the end for the long distance and inline for the short distance
  * Do not fall for the non-technical editor notes: the chapters are not as good as you think
  * Strive for high quality: pick a book in this subject, possibly by another author, and see what style they use. Might help you criticizing yours. Do not accept lower quality: your readers will thank you for it
  
  * Keep a higher overview of the chapters in paper
  * Never deliver the original notes to the author or publishing company: these notes are very valuable as they hold your initial thoughts while reading the book. Reviewing the notes might spark another thoughts
  

TODO: explain that some of the same patterns that apply for pair programming also apply here
