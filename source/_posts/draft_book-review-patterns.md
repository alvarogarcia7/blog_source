During book reviews:
  * Do not focus only on what it's written. Also focus on what it is not written (i.e., what is omitted)
  * You need to test every single code snippet. TODO better explain the analogy with a QA role
  * The short and long distance: mark / fix short distance errors: spelling, grammar, disconnected ideas, etc but also the long distance errors: this chapter is not complete, not easy to understand, take the reader's place and try to remove your own knowledge (so you can understand what the author wanted to say, not what you think the author wanted to)
  * Be kind to the coder but not to the code (from Egoless programming). A book and a piece of code are the result of the same idea: authoring
  * Strive for perfection, at least yours: take any (technical) book that you like as an example. In this case, [Implementation patterns](http://www.amazon.com/Implementation-Patterns-Kent-Beck/dp/0321413091) by Kent Beck is my example: each sentence is well thought and condensed. There is almost no superfluous information. Everything is there for a reason.
  * Add your ideas: at the end for the long distance and inline for the short distance
