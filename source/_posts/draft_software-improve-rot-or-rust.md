Does software improve, rust or rot?

2015-05-02 2106

What effects does time produce on software, without any external interaction?

  * Does it improve, as wine?
  * Does it rot, as food?
  * Does it rust, as (some) metal?

## Bettering

While the first option should be the usual case, as

"software is a learning process, with the byproduct of working software" (TODO find citation). TODO also cite the analogy of an investment, (IIRC, in SoCra).

It is difficult to introduce new features in software, without breaking old ones when you don't have executable specifications. Many feature requests (or even change requests [CR]) conflict with each other, therefore it is not possible to satisfy them all.

## Rotting

Before a carrot starts rotting, it goes through a phase of decreasing quality: it starts shrinking and getting wrinkled, as part of the water is getting out. After that process, the weakest link in the carrot skin will be pierced by external agents to start digging. The rot can also start from the inside, as any fruit or vegetable has some rotting agents inside. 

Think of it as a broken window: when several carrots are together and one of them starts rotting, the rest will accelerate in the same process. Even though it is a process that runs out of your control, you have to be actively looking for rotten carrots. Removing them on time is more beneficial than keeping them in the basket for the rest of the vegetables.

## Rusting

Let's take as an example a metal that actually rusts, like steel. Not stainless steel, though. The rusty layer is only on the outside, where the exposure to external elements happen. Below the rusty layer, there is the rest of the metal, not rusted (as still hasn't interacted with oxygen). So, in fact, the rust layer protects the rest of the metal. It is like someone "taking one for the team".

## Relationship with software

I don't think that software can better by itself, without any external interaction. 

It is true that wine does not improve on any situation, as it should be on a constant, stable environment: pressure, light, temperature, humidity, etc. So it is safe to assume that software should be under the same beneficial environment so it is possible to keep improving:

  * It should be kept in use and working knowledge spread among the users
  * It should have its defects fixed


Let's see what kind of comparison we can set between software an
