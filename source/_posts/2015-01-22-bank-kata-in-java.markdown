[Manuel Rivero][trikitrok] and I did a subset of the [bank kata](https://github.com/sandromancuso/Bank-kata), proposed by [Sandro Mancuso][sandro].

We've used java (mockito, hamcrest, junit), outside-in TDD. The code is spread among several sessions. We have not committed after each step, only at the end of the session.

The source code is on [github](https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/bank-kata)

You can read Manuel's take on the kata on [his blog](http://garajeando.blogspot.com.es/2015/01/kata-bank-account-in-java.html)
