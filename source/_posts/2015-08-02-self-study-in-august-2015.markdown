  * humble dialog
  * humble executable
  * humble transaction controller
  * humble container adapter

## How you know

I've reread [this small essay][how-you-know] by Paul Graham on storing information in our heads, based on the context. On the importance of rereading, to add more contexts to the initial one.

## The Key to Giving and Receiving Negative Feedback

I've read [this article][key-to-negative-feedback] by Joseph Grenny about how to give and receive negative feedback. It is exemplified by the plant manager who was expecting another kind of feedback from his subordinates and was surprised by their negative feedback.

## Using The Option Type Effectively

I've read [this article][effective-use-of-option] on how to use the ``Option`` type (in rust), similar to ``Optional`` in java or ``Maybe`` in haskell. Written by Uku Taht.

## When Should You Think?

I've read [this post][when-should-you-think] by Robert C Martin on when to think and the hypothesis that TDD does not allow you to think before coding.

## Orthogonal latin squares: an application of experiment design to compiler testing 

I've read [this paper][near-exhaustive-testing-using-latin-squares] by Robert Mandl on techniques that can be applied to reduce the burden of exhaustive testing to compilers. Preferring "surely all relevant distinct combinations" we can reduce the amount of testing. This paper tries to formalize the concept of "near-exhaustive testing"

##  Practical Type System Benefits

I've read [this article][practical-type-system-benefits] by Neil Brown on benefits of the type system, with examples in haskell. He goes on to explore the benefits of involving the type-checker at compile time to remove type errors and ease the programming effort:

> I find that several problems in Haskell can be solved by involving the type system
> further: The trick is to involve the type system in ways that provide a big benefit
> for the cost, but not going so far that the type system gets in the way of code
> that you know --but can’t easily prove to the compiler-- is safe

I've also learned the concept of the quasi-quoter: similar to a preprocessor, executed at compile time and type-checked

## ClojureScript and the Blub Paradox

## Haste: Full-Stack Haskell for Non-PhD Candidates

I've watched [this talk][full-stack-haskell] at the Strange Loop Conference 2014 about Haste language, a haskell version that compiles to javascript, therefore letting you write haskell in the browser. By Erin Swenson-Healey and James Cooper

In this talk they recommend the [CIS194 course][cis-194-course]

## A Year of Haskell

I've watched [this talk][a-year-of-haskell] about experiences using haskell professionally, by the American Justin Leitgeb in a Equatorian company in Quito, Stack Builders. He goes on to explain the haskell language in comparison to ruby on rails, what he mostly used with his clients.

Also explains what sells and doesn't (mostly productivity, not security) and gives pointer for applying it to a company

## A Taste of Haskell

I've watched a lesson by Simon Peyton-Jones, that introduces haskell to experienced programmers, not in the language but in programming in general. At the conference OSCON 2007

## History of Haskell: being lazy with class

I've watched [this video][history-of-haskell-lazy] by Simon Peyton-Jones at the "History of Programming Languages Conference III" which explains how the language was designed and written, a language timeline, what options they took, how they decided about monadic IO, etc.
