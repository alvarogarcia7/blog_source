## How you know

I've reread [this small essay][how-you-know] by Paul Graham on storing information in our heads, based on the context. On the importance of rereading, to add more contexts to the initial one.

## Orthogonal latin squares: an application of experiment design to compiler testing 

I've read [this paper][near-exhaustive-testing-using-latin-squares] by Robert Mandl on techniques that can be applied to reduce the burden of exhaustive testing to compilers. Preferring "surely all relevant distinct combinations" we can reduce the amount of testing. This paper tries to formalize the concept of "near-exhaustive testing"

##  Practical Type System Benefits

I've read [this article][practical-type-system-benefits] by Neil Brown on benefits of the type system, with examples in haskell. He goes on to explore the benefits of involving the type-checker at compile time to remove type errors and ease the programming effort:

> I find that several problems in Haskell can be solved by involving the type system
> further: The trick is to involve the type system in ways that provide a big benefit
> for the cost, but not going so far that the type system gets in the way of code
> that you know --but can’t easily prove to the compiler-- is safe

I've also learned the concept of the quasi-quoter: similar to a preprocessor, executed at compile time and type-checked

## Tracking Joy at Work

I've read [this article][tracking-joy-at-work] about quantifying happiness at the office (or at work). Joe Nelson, the author of the article, uses the quantifying method described int the book [Experience Sampling Method][experience-sampling-method-book] ([wikipedia page][experience-sampling-method-wiki]) by Hektner, Schmidt, Csikszentmihalyi.

## Going "Write-Only"

I've read [this article][going-write-only] by Joe Nelson on going "write-only" on social media, blogs, news, etc, as opposed to read-only (only consuming media) or read-write (consuming and producing). He cites another programmer, [Joey Hess][joey-hess] and about the quality and durability of your work.

## Hammock Driven Development

I've watched [this video][hammock-driven-development] by Rich Hickey. A few notes:

A: identifying a problem that we're trying to solve

D: assessing if the proposed solution solves the problem

the union of the features is not the purpose of the product / is not the product

proramming is not completing features

avoiding problems /= solving problems

book: how to solve it - G. Polya. Practices & techniques for solving mathematic problems

How to solve the problem

  * state the problem
  * understand the problem:
    * what do you know: facts, context, constraints.
    * what do you don't know
    * are there related problems? solutions to related problems. find an analogy: starting from scratch vs incremental step
  * be discerning
  * more input, better output:
    * read about your domain problem, research papers (maybe ACM)
  * tradeoffs:
    * find at least two options (ups and downs) to compare before taking a decision

Focus time for programmers like alone time for kids. Hammock time is important mind's eye time

Waking mind:

  * critical thinking
  * analysis
  * tactics
  * prone to local maxima
  * feed work to background mind
  * analyze its products

Background mind:

  * making connections
  * synthesis
  * strategy
  * abstracts, analogies
  * solves most non-trivial problems

loading it: work it hard in the waking mind to be included in the background mind

abstraction = software strategy

tip: small answer is better than big answer (occam's razor?)​
