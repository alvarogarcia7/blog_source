I've built a small maven module, to be used directly with cucumber. You can fork the repository [here](https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/base-bdd-cucumber)

This is the setup I've proposed for the meetup ["BDD Cucumber kata (gherkin + code)"](http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Barcelona-Meetup/events/220673134/). Will see if this code is successfully used by the ~40 participants in a couple of weeks

(Quote from the [README.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alvarogarcia7/base-bdd-cucumber/master/README.md)):

This maven project has been possible due to [Thomas Sundberg](https://twitter.com/@thomassundberg) and [this post](https://thomassundberg.wordpress.com/2014/05/29/cucumber-jvm-hello-world)

Should you want to, there's a tweet to thank him the effort: [tweet intent here](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@thomassundberg thanks for the cucumber bdd tutorial! Will be using it from @agilebcn;Keep up
the good work&url=https://thomassundberg.wordpress.com/2014/05/29/cucumber-jvm-hello-world/)

Happy katas and happy bdd'ing!
