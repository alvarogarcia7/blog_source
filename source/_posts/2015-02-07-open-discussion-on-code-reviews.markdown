We had a great conversation yesterday about code reviews.

The main idea was to discuss about it and share the ideas each one had. I didn't want it to turn into a masterclass (see the [white belt](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch02.html#the_white_belt))

## Benefits

This is the main benefits we saw in it:

  * Increased trust
  * Learning from others, other approaches
  * Less defects, more quality
  * Increased bus factor (TODO), decreased information silos

## Pair programming

Then we discussed about the topic of code reviews and pair programming:

  * How do they mix
    * Is the need for code review reduced when doing pair programming?
  * Does it give you the same benefits?

## Conclusion

 * No one was against it
 * We all agreed that is important to do it even in time-constrained environments
