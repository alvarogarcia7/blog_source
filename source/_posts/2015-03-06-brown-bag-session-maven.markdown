Yesterday we did a training about the maven tool. One of the team members explained to us some topics including:

  * lifecycles 
  * profiles and how to create one
    * slowTests for integration tests (this client only)
    * downloadJavadoc
    * downloadSources
  * convention over configuration
  * scopes of the dependencies (test, runtime, compile, provided)
  * tricks about the tool:
    * order of the dependencies (especially junit, hamcrest)
  * plugins and how to build one
  * destination folders
    * target, classes, test-classes, etc
