## Ruby Equality And Object Comparison

I've read [this article][ruby-equality-object-comparison], written by Alan Skorkin, that explains equality comparisons in ruby:

  * equal? is reference equality
  * == is value equality
  * eql? is value and type equality

Tags: ruby, comparison, equality, object, reference, alan-skorkin
