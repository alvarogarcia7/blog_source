Update: I've grouped all small posts related to the self-study from May 2015
into a single post


## Programmer passion considered harmful

I've read [this article][article-passion] on why programmer passion could be negative. The title is similar to a paper by Dijkstra.

## Software Craftsmanship: Are Bootcamps Enough?

I've read [this article][article-craft] on software craftsmanship, development bootcamps and passion by [Ken Auer][author]

## Improve your development environments with virtualization

I have seen this video: [Improve your development environments with virtualization][video-environments-virtualization] by Luke Sneeringer.

My notes:

  * development should be exactly like production.
  * except where it is too painful. there it should be different

## Buffer's take on values

I have found these [values][values-buffer], written by Buffer, very interesting.

## Public static void

I've watched this video: ["Public, static void"][video-pbs] by Rob Pike. The slides can be found [here][slides-pbs]

### My notes

* too much bureaucracy
* fighting the compiler
* dynamic vs static typing
* language too verbose 
* do not mix the two of them

* a language niche:

  * comprehensible
  * statically typed
  * light on the page
  * fast to work in
  * scales well
  * doesn't require tools but supports them well
  * good at networking and multiprocessing
  
  (minute 10:09)â€‹

* [Go][golang] was born to fill this niche

## The Cost of Test Driven Development

I've read [this article](http://blog.typemock.com/2009/03/the-cost-of-test-driven-development.html), on the cost of doing TDD, which refers to [this paper][nagappan-tdd]: Realizing quality improvement through test driven development: results and experiences of four industrial teams (below)

## Learn You Some Lisp for Great Good

I've watched the video [Learn You Some Lisp for Great Good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T00X_sNg4Q), by Howard Abrams.

I guess this is a reference to the popular [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/).

He suggests many interesting resources for learning Lisp dialects. The live coding is in Clojure:

  * [The land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com/)
  * [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/). See also [SICPQuotes](https://twitter.com/SICPQuotes)
  * [The Little Schemer](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer)
  * [An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/pdf/eintr.pdf)
  * [4clojure Questions](https://www.4clojure.com/)
  * [Clojure Koans](http://clojurekoans.com/)
  
On another topic, in the [Bank accounts exercise from Exercism](http://www.meetup.com/ClojureBCN/events/222418104/) meetup, we discussed the book [Programming Clojure (2nd edition)](https://pragprog.com/book/shcloj2/programming-clojure) by Stuart Halloway

## Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming

I've read [this guide][mostly-adequate-guide] to functional programming. It is still work in progress (WIP) but still interesting. Written in javascript, so you can REPL in the browser.

## Learning Code Good

I've watched this video, by Saron Yitbarek: [Learn Code Good][learning-code-good].

## Why You Don't Get Mock Objects

I've watched [Why You Don't Get Mock Objects][why-you-dont-get-mock-objects], by Gregory Moeck.

In it, they point to the [Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests][goos-book] book ([category here][goos-category]), the paper [Mock Roles, not Objects][mock-roles-not-objects] (also present in the GOOS book).
