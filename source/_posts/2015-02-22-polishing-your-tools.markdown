[Frederick P Brooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks), Jr quoted / explained a theory explained by Mills and Baker* around 1971-72:

> Chapter 3: The surgical team 
>
> [...] but the team be organized like a surgical team rather than a hog-butchering team. That is, instead of each member cutting away on the problem, one does the cutting and the others give him[her] every support that will enhance his[her] effectiveness and productivity.
>
> [...]

The author goes on to explain the job descriptions for the surgeon, copilot, administrator, editor, secretaries, program clerk, toolsmith, tester and the language lawyer.

The one that will be covered in this post is the toolsmith.

> **The toolsmith**. File-editing, text-editing, and interactive debugging services are now readily available, so that a team will rarely need its own machine and machine-operating crew. But these services must be available with unquestionably satisfactory response and reliability; and the surgeon must be sole judge of the adequacy of the service available to him. He needs a toolsmith, responsible for ensuring this adequacy of the basic service and for constructing, maintaining, and upgrading special tools --mostly interactive computer services-- needed by his team. Each team will need its own toolsmith, regardless of the excellence and reliability of any centrally provided service, for his job is to see to the tools needed or wanted by his surgeon, without regard to any other team's needs. The tool-builder will often construct specialized utilities, cataloged procedures, macro libraries.

Even though the chapter reads a bit outdated, especially with the part about genders and methodologies (i.e., waterfall), the part about roles is interesting. The surgical team, as the author presents will be composed by 9 1/2 (nine and a half) as the language lawyer can be shared among two or three teams.

So, one full-time job is to build tools to service the surgeon and the copilot (1:8,5 ratio), or approximately 12% of a full-time position.

These tools can make the surgeon and the copilot more effective, ranging from a single digit percentage to orders of magnitude in other tasks.

As agile teams no longer have a surgeon and the scrum master is not necessarily a technical expert who can build tools for the whole team, the tasks of creating tools must be taken care by everyone. No one better than yourself can know your needs and tailor solutions for them.

The only downside is you have to invest ~5h for a full time position of your personal time per week into creating and polishing tools for your work. But it is the only way of achieving more productivity when working.
