At the Craft Conf 2015 I saw someone with the book [Apprenticeship Patterns][apprenticeship-patterns-book] by [Dave Hoover][davehoover] and [Adewale Oshineye][ade_oshineye] and asked them about the book. After praising the contents, they asked me how to approach the book.

I recalled reading it non-sequentially, and explained it to them:

  * Read the introduction, preface, etc first
  * When you get to the patterns, pick one at random
  * ``10``: Read it and navigate through the ``see also``. 
  * If there are unread chapters from the ``see also``, ``goto 10``
  * Find the remaining unread chapters and read them, try to apply the same algorithm
  * Read the appendices and finishing words


Reading a connected chapter after the first one made me connect the dots much better than reading them sequentially.
