* What sound dies a code that is not being tested?
  * I only care for the observable behaviour, not the rest
  * All my behaviors should be tested. What is not tested is lost
  * The tests should be automatic as I want to execute them quite often
* my TDD + GTD setup
  * tags: GTD and TDD; add a link to Connor mendenhall
  * also connected to the idea of scratchpad.md; IIRC there was a blogpost about this already
* Software as a means to an end
* What motivates a developer: autonomy, mastery, purpose

  * however, it is delivered on time but doesnâ€™t fulfill the actual need, the specification must have been wrong, so the customer gets the blame - POODR, page 9 (sheet 34)
  * Idea that: if we break the "time" leg, it's the programmers; if we break the "scope" leg, it's the client


* There are more ideas in the TODO task management tool
* Inheritance and polymorphism
  * In OO we're taught they go hand in hand
  * In functional languages, you can have polymorphism without inheritance.
    * map, filter, ... work on sequences, vector, sets
	* add example of polymorphism without inheritance in java, simulating duck typing
  * you can have inheritance without polymorphism
    * maybe the main use of this is to statically type objects. but why do you want to specify types if the behavior is the same?
	* maybe this should not be done, as what you want is behavior, not types
  * Take a look at clojurescript-unraveled, section 3.10
* Brown-bag session on SaaS, by our SaaS architect
* Idea that solutions & products are the same as developers and operations and the devOps movement should also apply to both.
  * In a sufficiently modular software, any client-specific solution should be capable to be injected in the general product. 
  * Write example about this
* Write how to generate lazy generators in java or other non-lazy languages
  * Include code to generate Range (already implemented in java)
  * Compare with another utility library (e.g., Apache commons)
  * Compare with the Haskell and Clojure source
  * Compare with the yield keyword in python
* Add post on transducers and the clojure article (funcool.github.io/clojurescript-unraveled)
