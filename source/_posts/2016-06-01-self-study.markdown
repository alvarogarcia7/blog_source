## DiversityMediocrityIllusion

I've read this article by [Martin Fowler][DiversityMediocrityIllusion] (on his bliki) about the diversity in conferences and the profession. How it is our job to incentive a positive feedback cycle that brings more diverse people into the workforce.

Explains how they do it in ThoughtWorks and how they have changed in the last decade.

## How sharing other people’s feelings can make you sick

I've read [this article][sharing-feelings-empathy] by Emma Young on how being empathic to others can make you sick on their own illness. How illness can be socially transmitted, by loved ones or even by strangers.

How algorithms (that display news) can affect your own well-being and how this is reduced by using compassion instead of empathy.

Borders on the difference of empathy vs compassion.

## Advanced Logging with the JavaScript Console

I've watched [this course][js-console-for-power-users] by Mykola Bilokonsky at egghead.io.

In it, he covers the following methods on the console:

```javascript
console.log
console.warn
console.error
console.info
console.debug
```

The amount of parameters does not matter, it will put a space in between. printing an object will print its values

console.log with the C's printf syntax, as long as the first parameter is a string

```javascript
  %o for an object
  %c for CSS
```

```javascript
console.group / groupCollapsed / groupEnd
```
