layers of software:

  * DSL. TODO what is a DSL
  * Test-adapter
  * Test software
  * Production software (SUT)
  
Benefits:

 * everyone might involved in the specification by example workshops
 * live specifications. managers can now understand the real state
 * regression tests are much cheaper (from automation)

Gotchas:

 * Test only the happy paths
 * This has a cost, do not overdo it
 * Doesn't remove manual tests
 * How do you manage multiple scenarios
 * How fast should it be?
