After reading (in a specific order - below) part of the patterns in [Apprenticeship Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518387.do),
I stumbled upon the ["Your First Language"](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch02.html#your_first_language)

First of all, the illustration with the baby reading a Java book is priceless. 

Having said that, I came to the realization that you might not know a paradigm but just an implementation
(e.g., you don't know about Object-Oriented programming but just about Java)

PS: What a great book this is. I'm reading it in one of the specified ways: pick a pattern and start navigating
through the book following the "see also" 

PPS: you can read it online for free, [here](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/)
