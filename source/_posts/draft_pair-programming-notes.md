While pair programming, especially while using the driver-navigator variation, I like to take notes about:

  * What's on my mind at that moment
  * Future features related to the current one
  * Defects that will be taken care of
  * Other designs
  * TODO items for my personal / professional life
  
  
I think of it as low-level GTD. I really like to focus on the important stuff and later will review the notes. 

After processing the tasks / notes, I will cross the whole page meaning this has been taken care of (even if it's only adding it to a more durable / searchable list)
