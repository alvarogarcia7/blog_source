I've read [this paper][nagappan-tdd] by Nagappan, Maximilien, Bhat and Williams on the cost, advantages, pitfalls of doing TDD in industrial teams (private companies who create software).

## My notes

Abstract: 

> little empirical evidence supports or refutes the utility of this practice in an industrial context

* they seem to be talking about inside-out tdd as in chapter 2 (page 291), they talk about small units and then integrating them in a bigger context

### Benefits

taken from chapter 2 (page 292)

* Better design
* Efficiency
* Test assets
* Reducing defect injection

### Conclusions

> TDD seems to be applicable in various domains
>
> [TDD] can significantly reduce the defect density of developed software without significant productivity reduction [...]
>
> [...] an important aspect of TDD is the creation of tests assets.

Recommendations (this is all quotes):

  * Start TDD from the beginning of projects
  * For a team new to TDD, introduce automated build test integration towards the second third of the development phase
  * [...] add new tests every time a problem is found
  * Get the test team involved and knowledgeable about the TDD approach
  * Constantly running the unit tests [...]
  * Encourage fast unit test execution and efficient unit testing design
