After reading (in a specific order - below) part of the patterns in [Apprenticeship Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518387.do),
I stumbled upon the ["Your First Language"](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch02.html#your_first_language)

First of all, the illustration with the baby reading a Java book is priceless. 

Having said that, I came to the realization that you might not know a paradigm but just an implementation
(e.g., you don't know about Object-Oriented programming but just about Java), in the same fashion as you could not know about LISPs but only about an implementation, such as clojure.

Also, clicks with the idea of "code to interfaces, not implementations". Does it also click with you?

PS: What a great book this is. I'm reading it in one of the specified ways: pick a pattern and start navigating
through the book following the "see also" 

PPS: you can read it online for free, [here](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/)
