[^1]: Structured Design: Fundamentals of a Discipline of Computer Program and Systems Design by Yourdon and Constantine.

## Learning Programming Isnâ€™t That Hard, Deep Work Is Hard

I've read [this article][deep-work-shallow-work] by Benedict Fritz on two types of work (i.e., deep and shallow) and how programming is of the deep type. He links the difficulty of learning to program to the difficulty of practicing deep work.

## Tracer Bullets

I've read [this page][tracer-bullets] about tracer bullets, an analogy from the military warfare to a software project.

Serves the purpose of adjusting the aim of the cannon to better reach the target.

## Cohesion - the cornerstone of software design

I've read [this article][cohesion-in-software-design] by Sandro Mancuso on the topic of cohesion. Describes the 7 types of cohesion, as described in Structured Design[^1], from worst to best:

 * Coincidental cohesion
 * Logical cohesion
 * Temporal cohesion
 * Procedural cohesion
 * Communicational/informational cohesion
 * Sequential cohesion
 * Functional cohesion

and about Design-Level Cohesion:

  * Coincidental relation (R1)
  * Conditional relation (R2)
  * Iterative relation (R3)
  * Communication relation (R4)
  * Sequential relation (R5)
  * Functional (R6)

## Etsy CTO Q&A: We Need Software Engineers, Not Developers

I've read [this interview][engineers-vs-developers] with John Allspaw, where they explain the onboarding experience for new hires at Etsy, the DevOps philosophy and the need for engineering skills, more than developer skills. This can be exemplified in the need to know more, defining the boundaries of your job and finding the right tool for the job.
