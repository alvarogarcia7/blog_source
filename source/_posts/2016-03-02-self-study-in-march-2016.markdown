## Learning Programming Isnâ€™t That Hard, Deep Work Is Hard

I've read [this article][deep-work-shallow-work] by Benedict Fritz on two types of work (i.e., deep and shallow) and how programming is of the deep type. He links the difficulty of learning to program to the difficulty of practicing deep work.

## Tracer Bullets

I've read [this page][tracer-bullets] about tracer bullets, an analogy from the military warfare to a software project.

Serves the purpose of adjusting the aim of the cannon to better reach the target.
