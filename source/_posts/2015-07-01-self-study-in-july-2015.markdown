I've grouped all small posts related to the self-study from July 2015 into a single post

## Clojure made simple

I've watched [this talk][clojure-made-simple] by Rich Hickey at the Java One. It references the talk [Easy made simple](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy)

  * polymorphism without inheritance; single dispatch on the first parameter
