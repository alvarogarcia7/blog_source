## Call me maybe: RabbitMQ

I've read [this article][rabbit-mq-as-lock-service] by Kyle Kingsbury on using RabbitMQ as a lock service. It investigates and gives a counterexample of using it for this purpose.

Uses Knossos to do the testing and surfaces a problem with it. Explains specific problems on locking: at-most-once and at-least-once message delivery

Note: References Jepsen (I guess an inside joke to the song "Call me maybe" by Carly Rae Jepsen) for at-most-once and at-least-once message delivery.

## Everyone is potentially a teacher

I've read [this article][everyone-a-teacher] by Carlos Bl√© where he explains that everyone can have ideas worth spreading and that the knowledge not only comes from others but also from the relationships that tie you to other people.

## Ragel State Machine Compiler

I've read [this article][ragel-fsm] explaining what the Ragel project is about: a code generator from regex to code in languages such as C#, Java, etc. It is limited to finite state machines (FSM), with determinism. It can also handle some indeterminism. Written by Adrian D. Thurston
