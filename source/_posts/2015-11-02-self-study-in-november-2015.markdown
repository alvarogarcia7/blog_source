## Call me maybe: RabbitMQ

I've read [this article][rabbit-mq-as-lock-service] by Kyle Kingsbury on using RabbitMQ as a lock service. It investigates and gives a counterexample of using it for this purpose.

Uses Knossos to do the testing and surfaces a problem with it. Explains specific problems on locking: at-most-once and at-least-once message delivery

Note: References Jepsen (I guess an inside joke to the song "Call me maybe" by Carly Rae Jepsen) for at-most-once and at-least-once message delivery.

## Everyone is potentially a teacher

I've read [this article][everyone-a-teacher] by Carlos Bl√© where he explains that everyone can have ideas worth spreading and that the knowledge not only comes from others but also from the relationships that tie you to other people.

## Ragel State Machine Compiler

I've read [this article][ragel-fsm] explaining what the Ragel project is about: a code generator from regex to code in languages such as C#, Java, etc. It is limited to finite state machines (FSM), with determinism. It can also handle some indeterminism. Written by Adrian D. Thurston

## HTTP is obsolete. It's time for the distributed, permanent web

I've read [this article][permanent-web] by Kyle Drake explaining the need for a permanent, distributed web archive.

Using a distributed file system (IPFS) and software similar to Bitcoin, they can host parts of the web locally, making it immutable and distributed

## Recovering From the Integrated Tests Scam

I've read this article from J. B. Rainsberger on the integrated test scam and how to solve it: refactoring.

## Broken windows theory

I've read [this wikipedia article][broken-windows-theory] that talks about the broken windows theory, that states that controlling and monitoring public spaces leads to lowering the serious crimes.

Cites three causes for this:

  * Social norms and conformity
  * Lack of routing monitoring
  * Social signaling and signal crime

Also discusses examples in the US and in the Netherlands, as well as criticisms.

I've read it to better understand how to apply this theory to software development, on a day-to-day basis.
