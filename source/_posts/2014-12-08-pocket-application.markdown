This is a free application I use quite often: [pocket](http://getpocket.com/)

They promote it as "When you find something you want to view later, put it in Pocket."

I really use for that. Once you install it in your phone, some handy shortcuts appear both on Chrome for saving the page and on twitter when you hit the "share" button.

It is especially useful when you're on the tube and have no connection, as pocket saves an offline version of the page (warning: this doesn't work for video sites like youtube)
