This was a low-hanging fruit as a team member who specialises in QA complained about testing in the last moment during the last sprint's retrospective.

Did the grunt job of connecting the dots and configuring the maven project (using jbehave). Also, got the inspiration from a tutorial.

Announced it only as it was in place and QA approved of it

This grunt job clicked with [Sweep the floor](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch04.html#solution_id21)

Let's see how the sprint goes and what are the pain points during this sprint
