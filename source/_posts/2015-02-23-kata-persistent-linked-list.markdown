I've just written a new kata, about a persistent linked list.

It is using the same project as for the [linked list kata](https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/kata-linkedlist).

For now, only the ``add``, ``contains`` and ``size`` methods are implemented.

If you have any comments or code review, please let me know
