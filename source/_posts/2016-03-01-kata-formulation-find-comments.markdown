## Formulation

Little Johnny is inspecting a PHP source code that contains comments. These comments contains words that he doesn't understand, as it written in another language.

Please do not read ahead, just read the current assignment, do it, then read the next one:

    1. Can you help Little Johnny fetch all those comments?
    1. Can you translate all those comments (E.g., using google translate) and put them back into the same place in the original source code?
    1. These messages have not been audited yet and we want to publish the code, so it is better to hide/remove the comments. Can you do it?
