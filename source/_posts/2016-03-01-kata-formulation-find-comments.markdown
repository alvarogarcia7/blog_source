## Formulation

Little Johnny is inspecting a PHP source code that contains comments. These comments contains words that he doesn't understand, as it written in another language.

Please do not read ahead, just read the current assignment, do it, then read the next one:

  1. Can you help Little Johnny fetch all those comments?
  1. These messages have not been audited yet and we want to publish the code, so it is better to hide/remove the comments. Can you do it?

## Samples

The code (both project and samples) can be [found here](https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/kata-formulation-find-comments)

## Restrictions

When the problem is finished (you can attack in your preferred order), there must be an executable jar with some parameters to process the current folder with the 'working modes' specified above.
