I've watched this video: ["Public, static void"][video] by Rob Pike. The slides can be found [here][slides]

## My notes

* too much bureaucracy
* fighting the compiler
* dynamic vs static typing
* language too verbose 
* do not mix the two of them

* a language niche:

  * comprehensible
  * statically typed
  * light on the page
  * fast to work in
  * scales well
  * doesn't require tools but supports them well
  * good at networking and multiprocessing
  
  (minute 10:09)â€‹

* [Go][golang] was born to fill this niche
