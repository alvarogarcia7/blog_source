[Adrian Bolboaca][adibolb] has written a very interesting post on being a community bumble-bee. (Source can be found [here][original-post])

He goes on to explain how he has visited many meetups all over Europe and the big part he has learned from them.

He tells us about a selfish approach to organizing meetups:

I share this feeling of learning while teaching, as long as you reflect and analyze (e.g., [hansei](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansei) or [reflect as you work](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch05.html#reflect_as_you_work)). I also try to apply it to my meetups.

As a funny note, he said this cross-pollination has crystallized in as many ideas as to fill three books.
