In this paper TODO find link TODO, Peter Naur TODO find link TODO creates the analogy of programming as building theory.

He tries to understand what programming is (page 227). I find a subtle reference at the end of the 227.6 paragragraph to knowledge workers:

 > [...] programmers form or achieve a certain kind of insight, a theory [...] in contrast to [...] [programming] regarded as a production of a programs and certain other texts.

 This view suggests that programmers are not only text writers (i.e., typewriters) but need deeper insights into the problem at hand.
