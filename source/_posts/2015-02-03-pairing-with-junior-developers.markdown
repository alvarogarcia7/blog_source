* controversial topic:
** cannot measure a level higher than yours (TODO find reference)
** different areas of knowledge
** different pressures & motivations
** passion

* When and where are you a junior and a senior?
** depends on each job?
** each product you work?
** each team?

* Is there only one senior per team?
** Can everybody be a senior? If so, is everyone a junior? (if everything matters, nothing matters)
** Who choses the senior within the team?

* Do titles matter?
** Does authority come from the title or from the work you do?
