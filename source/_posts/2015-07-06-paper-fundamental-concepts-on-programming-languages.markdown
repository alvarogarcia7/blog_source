## Contents

This paper starts slow, from the mathematical and philosophical point of view, until it gets to the basic concepts on the fundamental concepts:

  * Assignment command
  * L-Value and R-Value
  * Definitions
  * Names
  * Numerals
  * Conceptual models: an explanation about the relationship between the code, the memory store and the abstract concepts

Later, it gets more in depth to the conceptual constructs, where most of the content is explained and contains:

  * Expressions and commands
  * Expressions and evaluations
  * Commands and sequencing
  * Definition of functions and routines
  * Functions and routines as data items
  * Types and polymorphism
  * Compound data structures

Finally, as closing notes, it explains some implementation details (such as Load-Update Pairs), tools as Macrogenerators (nowadays called macros) and formal semantics
