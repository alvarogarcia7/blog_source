At a client, today I've introduced the eXtreme Programmig methodology, with its values, principles, practices in a brown-bag session.

It has been an informal session, without slides, but we have used [this video][intro-xp-kleer] by the Kleer guys (in Spanish).

The video gives a high-level overview of what XP is. We also needed to cover the daily practices (e.g., TDD, pair programming, whole team)

After that, we've done a questions&answers round to solve the teammates' doubts
