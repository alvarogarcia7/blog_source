## How we built Uber engineering's highest query per second service using Go

I've read [this post][uber-go-geofence] by Kai Wei on a microservice they've built using Go. 

Explains the reasons for choosing that algorithm for geofencing, the performance they're achieving, and the architecture.

## Unwinding Uber's Most Efficient Service

I've read [this article][comment-on-uber-geofencing] by Buck Heroux commenting on the decisions of Uber for building the geofencing microservice (above read).

Explains the different alternatives for algorithms in this problem space and has implemented them in go. Provides a benchmark for comparing those, including a profiling session.
