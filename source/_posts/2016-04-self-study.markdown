## A Side Project Helped Jumpstart My Career â€” Life Learning

I've read [this article][side-project-why] by Dave Gerhardt on how making a side project happen affected his life and his skills.

Some of the reasons for doing it include:

  * The only way to learn is by doing
  * It gets your brain working on something other than your job
  * You have to create your own network
  * You are the CEO
