Today we have done a brown bag session about Docker. One of the team members explained to us the latest news, topics and how tos, including:

  * the difference between a container and an image
  * diffing image contents
  * AUFS (Another Union FS)
  * persistent vs non-persistent (volatile) filesystems
  * running CMD and other commands on the instance
  * problems of running with permission = root (or its group)
  * downsides of it
  * how to compare it with a virtual machine
