At a client, today we've done an internal training on [angular js][angular]: we've prepared some [slides][slides] and a live demo.

The repository with all the information can be found [here][repo].

Apparently, the training has been a success, given that most of the talent in the team is backend focused (as opposed to full-stack) and changing from java to javascript is not straight-forward.

Note: this post has been created a posteriori, dated with the correct training timestamp.
