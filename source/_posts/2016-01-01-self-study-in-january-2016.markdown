## What Is Functional Programming?

I've read [this article][what-is-fp] by Kris Jenkins where the author describes functional programming from an input & output point of view.

Describes state of the system (maybe global or local) is input & output of the function

Produced state changes are called side effects. the author calls the state inputs as "side causes".

Side effects and causes are called complexity iceberg, as they are not visible under the water level (surface)

Also what a pure function is: one with no side causes or side effects; e.g., all its inputs are declared inputs (i.e., parameters) and all outputs are declared outputs (i.e., return value).
