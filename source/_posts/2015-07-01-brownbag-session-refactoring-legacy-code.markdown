Today I have done a brown bag session about refactoring legacy code. It includes:

  * legacy code definition. There is no agreement about this in the team.
  * the legacy code change algorithm (source is Feathers, Working effectively with legacy code). Plus an example about it.
  * working with legacy code
  * experience with it.

The slides are available [here][slides] (PDF format)

[slides]: /{{site.category_dir}}/../uploads/refactoring-legacy-code-slides.pdf

We also did a practical session, whose experience report is [here](../../../../2015/06/23/brown-bag-session-refactoring-legacy-code/)
