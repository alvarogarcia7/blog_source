For a series of posts and other writings, I'm producing, on purpose, legacy code. With tests, but legacy code. 

I'm trying to create code that is legacy, but still clean code. The responsibilities should be separated, naming, SOLID, KISS, etc. And I'm finding more and more difficulties to write it, so it does not always exploit the same (few) smells:

  * TODO smell 1: too many dependencies. breaking dependencies
  * TODO smell 2: tests are too high-level / slow / not good enough
  * TODO smell 3: so many complicated codes after stack of patches.
  * TODO smell 4: lack of refactoring
