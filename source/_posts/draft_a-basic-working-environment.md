Sometimes, when working out of somebody's else computer, I won't have my preferred IDE installed. 

In this case, what I usually do --as long as the programming session is more than 5 cycles--, is to configure my own environment. It includes:

  * text editor: $EDITOR is enough
  * test runner. A simple bash script executing the tests will suffice
  * git terminal: to commit, see differences, revert, etc
  * [optional] REPL if the language has it
