## Expectations, Outcomes, and Challenges of Modern Code Review

I've read [this paper][modern-code-review], [direct link][modern-code-review-direct-link], by Alberto Bacchelli and Christian Bird on code review at Microsoft.

They explain how they do it, the exact methodology they are using and why they do it.

The main reasons to code review are:

  * finding defects
  * code improvement
  * alternative solutions
  * knowledge transfer
  * team awareness and transparency
  * also:
    * improve development process
    * avoid build breaks
    * share code ownership
    * track rationale
    * team assessment
