Today we did a [^1] using the string calculator [^2] using pair programming, TDD and some mob-programming for the last refactoring.


Using a beamer so everyone can see it

We've all learnt about shotcuts, live user templates for the IDE [^3], TDD methodology, other ways of tackling the problem, how to refactor as a group, clean code, etc

These sessions are necessary to share some knowledge among the teammates, have another chance of doing code review.

We've had such a great time, learning together, that would be a candidate for a weekly interaction

[^1]: TODO find the style of practice we did. hint: http://johannesbrodwall.com/2011/12/18/how-to-start-a-coding-dojo/
[^2]: TODO add a link to the calculator kata
[^3]: TODO find a link


TODO Complete info about:
  - mob programming
  - QA coming
  - team member not coming
  - length: 1,5h
  - the point is not to get there but to enjoy the path to get there
  - baby steps
TODO complete info about QA coming
TODO complete info about a team member not coming
