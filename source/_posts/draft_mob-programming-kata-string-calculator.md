Last Friday we did a kata[^1] using a projector the string calculator [^2] using pair programming, TDD and some mob-programming for the last refactoring.

We used a projector (beamer) so everyone could see it. I tried to take really small baby steps but the adding part was done in ~6 cycles[^4]

We've all learnt about shotcuts, live user templates for the IDE [^3], TDD methodology, other ways of tackling the problem, how to refactor as a group, clean code, etc

These sessions are necessary to share some knowledge among the teammates and have another chance of doing code review, releasing some pressure from daily practices or bad abstractions / designs (that will be taken care of in the future)

We've had such a great time, learning together, that would be a candidate for a weekly interaction.

[Mob programming][mob-programming] is such an eye opening practice. It forces you to reconsider your previous dogma and to understand the others' positions. Wikipedia reads "early use of phrase [...] was made in 'Extreme Programming Perspectives'" but this practice is practiced by some, such as [Carlos Bl√©][carlosble], [Sandro Mancuso][mancuso] among others; also at the Software Craftsmanship Barcelona 2013 and [2014][scbcn2014] and the [SoCra Canaries 2015][socracan]

[^1]: matching none of the styles explained in [here][kata-styles]
[^2]: This is a very good beginner's kata, created by [Roy Osherove][osherove]. Can be found [here][string-calculator]
[^3]: There are some for [IntelliJ IDEA][intellij-live-templates], [Eclipse][eclipse-live-templates] too
[^4]: One piece of feedback I received is that I talk too much while coding, as these 6 cycles took us about 45 minutes, total
