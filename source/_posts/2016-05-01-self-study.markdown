## Being A Developer After 40

I've read [this article][developer-after-40] by Adrian Kosmaczewski on the required topics to be a developer at age 40 and keep enjoying it:

  * Forget The Hype
  * Choose Your Galaxy Wisely
  * Learn About Software History
  * Keep on Learning
  * Teach
  * Workplaces Suck
  * Know Your Worth
  * Send The Elevator Down
  * LLVM

He references galaxy, the big stack you are positioned (JVM, .net, PHP, etc). He makes a special mention of the LLVM

> Take conscious decisions in your life. Be aware of your actions and their effect. Do not blush or be embarrased for changing your opinions. Say “I’m sorry” when required. Listen. Do not be a hotshot. Have integrity and self-respect.

Recommends these books:

## Firing people

I've read [this article][firing-people] by Zach Holman on firing people at your current work, both from the perspective of the employee (fired), employer, coworker.

Also explains his personal experience of being fired from Github.
