I've written a sample project with an annotation and an aspect to intercept it and decorate it.

The code provides a way of doing ``try|catch``, specifying an exception to be caught.

The source code is available [here](https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/annotation-aspect-java)

## In the process

This has taken me approximately one hour to prepare the spike and half more to refactor and massage a bit.

If you want to see the raw details, the refactor has been committed step by step (the spike hasn't). The unmassaged code can be found [here](https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/annotation-aspect-java/tree/d5e61ca56a38b1611c9acaa61a2e169b14d19d1e). The massaged version is at the [tip of the arrow](https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/annotation-aspect-java/)
