## Ten Habits of a Good Programmer

I've read [this list][habits-good-programmer] of good habits of good programmers by Pieter Hintjens:

  1. If it works and is still useful, don't throw it out.
  1. Never solve the same problem twice in parallel.
  1. Solve the same problem often in serial.
  1. Write code, and repeat, until you are fluent in your language.
  1. Learn to use code generators.
  1. Work with others.
  1. Technology is a tool, not a tribal affiliation.
  1. Aim for this cycle: learn, play, work, teach.
  1. Get your edit-compile-run-fail cycles down to seconds.
  1. If you need debuggers, you're doing it wrong.
