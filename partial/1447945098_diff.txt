## Four Laws Of Software Economics (Part 1)

I've read [this article][sw-economics-1] by Rich Mironov on why the development team will never be big enough (because of economics, because there are more things to be done than time to do them, so we have to prioritize them) and about the communication problems between the dev team and the client(s).

Also talks about the general personality of clients and devs and task prioritization
