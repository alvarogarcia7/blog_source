## Open Salaries: Outcomes

I've read [this article][lunar-open-salaries] by Paweł Brodziński on how the open salaries has affected them in their company (Lunar Logic): 

  * removing the bottleneck for salary reviews
  * making more often and better the feedback process
  * people more involved in running the company
