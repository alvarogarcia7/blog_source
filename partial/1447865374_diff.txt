## Jessica Livingston

I've read [this essay][jessica-livingston] by Paul Graham about his co-founder at the Y-combinator: Jessica Livingston. She was considered the Social Radar at YC

The essay also talks about the non-existent separation between working hours and not and about her implication and personality.
