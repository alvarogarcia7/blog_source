## Monads, part two

I've read [this article][monad-2-lippert] by Eric Lippert, in which he describes monad examples in the C# code. Also describes what an 'amplifier' is. I relate it to composing behavior.

> An "amplifier" is something that increases the representational power of their "underlying" type.
