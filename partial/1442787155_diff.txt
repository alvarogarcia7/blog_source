## Do you really get classloaders?

I've watched [this video][really-get-classloaders] by Jevgeny Kabanov on classloaders: what they are, how they work nad some tips to solve common issues.

My notes:

  * the classloading is lazy: the resources are not loaded until they are mentioned
  * every classloader has a parent
  * every class has a classloader associated with it
  * every object has a class associated with it
  * classloading delegation: the parent is consulted before loading a class. if it has it, it will load it. If not, I will delegate it

There is also [this article][comments-on-classloaders] on the same video
