## What's the difference between equal?, eql?, ===, and ==?
I've read [this stackoverflow][ruby-eql-comparison] question regarding Ruby operators: equal?, eql?, ===, ==:

  * ==: generic equality
  * ===: case equality (for case - when)
  * eql?: hash equality
  * equal?: identity comparison (pointer comparison)
