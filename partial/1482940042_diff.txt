## Debug.Trace

I've read both [the documentation][debug-trace-haskell] and the source code for `Debug.Trace`, a haskell module that contains functions to trace a program execution. It is interesting to see how a function performs side effects and its signature seems to be pure.

The main trick is to use `unsafePerformIO`, which points to `unsafeDupablePerformIO`, which performs a side effect on the Real World (`runRW#`).
