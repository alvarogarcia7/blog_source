## Speak like a leader

I've watched [this TEDx Talk][tedx-speak-leader] by Simon Lancaster in which he explains the importance of rhetoric in our speech. Explains 6 techniques for achieving better communication:

  * Three breathless sentences: "Mangia Bene, Ridi Spesso, ama molto", "Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Fuhrer"
  * Three repetitive sentences
  * Three balancing statements: if we hear the statements as balanced, we imagine that the underlaying thinking is balanced
  * Metaphor
  * Exaggeration
  * Rhyme
