## When automation goes horribly wrong

I've read this article by Gojko Adzic on a story of a manual process that was automated.

> Because it focused too much on replacing humans instead of assisting them, MiDAS actually made it more difficult for clerks to access the data they needed for review

This reminded me of the framework vs library discussion:

  * in frameworks you relinquish the control, putting your code into the allocated holes.
  * using the automated system, you can only check the claim at a certain spot, where the system lets you do.

The system and the framework have been designed to take control of the situation. Both successful at what they do
