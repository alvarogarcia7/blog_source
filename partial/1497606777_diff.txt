## [Is the keyboard faster than the mouse?](http://danluu.com/keyboard-v-mouse/)

I've read this article by Dan Luu comparing the use of the mouse and the use of the keyboard and their speeds. 
He groups existing literature on the topic plus some experiments he has done himself.

Mentions the amount of myths related to this, based on old and non-accurate research.
