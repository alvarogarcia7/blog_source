## Three Common Mistakes of the First Time Tech Lead

I've read [this article][mistakes-tech-lead] by Patrick Kua, in which he explains what are the anti-patterns (or mistakes) of a tech lead. They do not only apply to first timers, but more experienced ones as well.

I especially like a comment:

> Take all blame and give all credit: I ensure I always take the blame from the stakeholders when something is broken but when they praise, I say its all my teams efforts and I am just guiding them.
