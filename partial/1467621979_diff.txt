## Read This Story Without Distraction (Can You?)

I've read [this article][story-without-distraction] by Verena von Pfetten on the effects on multitasking in our daily lives. Also comments on the movement of monotasking or unitasking, which is the opposite of multitasking: doing one thing at a time.

Underlines the benefits of monotasking and how this is related to mindfulness and psychological benefits.
