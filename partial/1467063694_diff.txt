## Serverless Architectures

I've read [this evolving article][serverless-architectures] by Mike Roberts on what is and is not Serverless: [mobile] backend as a service or function as a service.

Converts some n-tier applications into serverless ones, expliciting that this is only a way of doing it, not necessarily the way he would do it
