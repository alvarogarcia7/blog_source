## [Facebook Open Source with Tom Occhino](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/04/14/facebook-open-source-with-tom-occhino/)

I've listened to this podcast in which Tom Occhino speaks about his experience as manager for a team that produces open source.

He mentions the two basic roles in such a team: the speaker, that represents the product itself and the maintainer, that caters to the community maintaining the software alive

He mentions that Facebook only releases open source that they use internally and that has solved a problem for them. Describes how the adoption should be: with a single client at first, then go for early adopters and then the masses
