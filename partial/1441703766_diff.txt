## Thermodynamics and Garbage Collection

I've read [this paper][thermogc] by Henry G. Baker that explains the analogy of the garbage collection ("a freezer") and thermodynamics, where the state mutator (th program, also an oven) modifies the garbage heap and introduces / extracts entropy into the system.

Comparison between entropy and lack of information, using the theories from Shannon, Maxwell-Boltzmann. There's a reference to the knapsack problem and to simulated annealing. 

There's also a gentle introduction to thermodynamics in layman terms: heat, temperature, microstates, macrostates, reversability, etc.
