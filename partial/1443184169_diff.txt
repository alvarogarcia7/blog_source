## Broken windows theory

I've read [this wikipedia article][broken-windows-theory] that talks about the broken windows theory, that states that controlling and monitoring public spaces leads to lowering the serious crimes.

Cites three causes for this:

  * Social norms and conformity
  * Lack of routing monitoring
  * Social signaling and signal crime

Also discusses examples in the US and in the Netherlands, as well as criticisms.

I've read it to better understand how to apply this theory to software development, on a day-to-day basis.
