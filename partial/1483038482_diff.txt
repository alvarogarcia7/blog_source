## Monads, part elevel

I've read [this article][monad-11-lippert] by Eric Lippert, in which he describes the "additive monad":

> * There is a zero value of every construction of the monadic type.
> * There is a way to add two monads with the same underlying type together.
> * The zero value is the identity of the add operation.
> * Using bind to apply any function to the zero produces the zero.
> * Using bind to apply the function a=\>zero to any M<A> produces the zero.
