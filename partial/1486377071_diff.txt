## The Dark Standup

I've read [this article][dark-standup] by Alan Brouilette on the steps they took to reduce the amount of hours worked. It started with a few extra questions during the daily standup:

> * What didn’t you do today because you stopped working on time?
> * What will the impact be on tomorrow because of it?
> * How much more time would you have needed to get everything done today?
> * What will you do with those hours tonight instead?

and what they realized after a two-week experiment:

> * The costs of context switching are much higher than we realized.
> * We were spending a lot of time doing things that were urgent but not important, or that didn’t need to have been urgent at all.
> * We needed to be a lot more ruthless about saying “No.”
> * Some Operations roles are legitimately shorthanded, some of us just needed to impose a little order.
> * FOMO WIP (unnecessary work one takes on because one fears missing something) is a real problem, especially as regards to Slack and meetings.
> * We worked better in the time we had to work, knowing it was finite.
> * Work-life balance improves both work and life. People literally slept better when limiting after-hours exposure to Slack and email. [...]
