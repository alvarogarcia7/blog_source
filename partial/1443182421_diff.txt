## Disruptor: High performance alternative to bounded queues for exchanging data between concurrent threads

I've read [this white paper][white-paper-disruptor] describing the disruptor framework: a way of exchanging data between concurrent threads.

It uses a ring buffer and other techniques to eliminate write contention, reduce read contention and produces good results. It was developed for a financial exchange environment but it's general purpose.
