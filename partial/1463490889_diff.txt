## How sharing other peopleâ€™s feelings can make you sick

I've read [this article][sharing-feelings-empathy] by Emma Young on how being empathic to others can make you sick on their own illness. How illness can be socially transmitted, by loved ones or even by strangers.

How algorithms (that display news) can affect your own well-being and how this is reduced by using compassion instead of empathy.

Borders on the difference of empathy vs compassion.
