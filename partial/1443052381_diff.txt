## Turing completeness

I've read [this wikipedia article][turing-completeness] (both main and discussion) about this subject. 

It has sounded strange to me the reference to S-expressions:

> Data languages
The notion of Turing-completeness does not apply to languages such as XML, HTML, JSON, YAML and S-expressions because they are typically used to represent structured data, not describe computation [...]

If data (S-expression) is represented as the same format as code (e.g., Lisp's S-expression) and the latter is used to represent a computation, shouldn't be "data languages that also are used as computation languages" excluded from that list?

As a side note, Lisp is Turing Complete (see [Turing Complete#Examples][turing-complete-examples])
