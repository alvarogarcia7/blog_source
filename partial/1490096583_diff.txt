## Bored People Quit

I've read [this article][bored-quit] by Michael Lopp on what are some mechanisms why bored people quit.

Some interesting quotes:

> My gig is the care and feeding of engineers, and their productivity is my productivity. If they all leave, I have exactly no job.

> My job isnâ€™t just building product; I also build people.
