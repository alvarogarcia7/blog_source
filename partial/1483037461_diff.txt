## Monads, part seven

I've read [this article][monad-7-lippert] by Eric Lippert, in which he states the three laws of monads:

> * Applying the construction function to a given instance of the monad produces a logically identical instance of the monad.
> * Applying a function to the result of the construction function on a value, and applying that function to the value directly, produces two logically identical instances of the monad.
> * Applying to a value a first function followed by applying to the result a second function, and applying to the original value a third function that is the composition of the first and second functions, produces two logically identical instances of the monad.
