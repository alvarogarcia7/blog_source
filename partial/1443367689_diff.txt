## The Lisp Curse

I've read [this essay][lisp-curse] by Rudolf Winestock, where he explains the low barrier (or low cost) for people in powerful languages (such as Lisp) to not accept the status quo in their project and fork / start their own.

It also compares languages and the people attracted to them. Cites Mark Tarver's essays several times, including the Brilliant Bipolar Mind (BBM) in [this other][bipolar-lisp-programmer] essay (from WebArchive). Compares the BBM and the normal worker in usefulness to companies.

Cites the Pareto principle (80-20 rule): a single hacker will port 80% the library from another language, leaving it buggy, undocumented and only understandable by the original author (assuming this is only 20% of the work). The rest (e.g., documentation, bugfixing, maintenance) are dropped and never taken care of.

Cites that this could be somewhat based on the facility of creating new features for the language. A small effort implies small implementation time, leaving no margin for thinking it through and seeing other corner cases. Also, a single person working on the project means no code review. The style might be coherent (always the same one), but might not be idiomatic, understandable by others, maintainable, etc.

Closes the essay with this quote:

> The expressive power of Lisp has drawbacks. There is no such thing as a free lunch.
