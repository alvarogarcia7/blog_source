## [Political Bots with Samuel Woolley](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/04/17/political-bots-with-samuel-woolley/)

I've listened to this podcast in which Samuel Woolley explains the current situation with bots, how they try to influence the decisions.

Not only by suggesting new products and services to buy, but also creating a void that can be filled by a person or group.

He explains some strategies to decide whether some social media activity is real or augmented.
