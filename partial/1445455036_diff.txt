## Five reasons to learn Clojure and Emacs together

I've read [this article][learning-clojure-emacs-together] by Jon Pither advocating the learning of Clojure and Emacs at the same time. The main reasons are: liberation, change, support, simplicity, mass adoption.

Cites that being hard to learn a new editor is a good idea to separate those who are willing to invest the time in learning (both an editor and a new language) from those who don't.
