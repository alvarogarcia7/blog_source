## Code is Data, Data is Code

I've read [this article][code-is-data-is-code-donelan] by James Donelan on the equivalence of code and data in homoiconic languages, including Clojure.

The article talks about homoiconicity, manually creating Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) out of data and the macro environment. Also, compares the difference between macros and functions.
