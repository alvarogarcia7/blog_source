## Compilers as Assistants

I've read [this article][compilers-assistant] by Evan Czaplicki on seeing the compiler as an assistant to your work, instead of an adversary. Of how the compiler should give the most useful errors and warnings.

He also explains what features have been removed from the Elm language in 0.16.
