## 6 Rules To Live By When You Work In An Office But Have Remote Team Members

I've read [this article][remote-team-members] by Lauren Moon about how trello works remotely:

  * Value Individuals Over Infrastructure
  * Avoid Impromptu Meetings At Someone’s Desk
  * If One Person Is On A Video Call, EVERYONE Is On A Video Call
  * Communication Is Asynchronous. Deal With It.
  * Socializing Is Not Around A Watercooler
  * The Tools You’re Using Matter. A Lot.
