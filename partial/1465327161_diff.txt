## Expert Resumé Driven Development

I've read [this article][expert-rdd] by Tariq Ali, where he explains the Resume-Driven Development, as a subset of the Principal-Agent Problem:

> The Principal (management) hires an Agent (a developer) to build a program and
> allow the Agent to choose the tech stack. But the Agent's interest (making his resumé
> more impressive) can be orthogonal to the Principal's interest (producing a great
> product by using the "right tool" for the job). If the Principal allows the Agent to
> do as he wish, then the Agent will do as he wishes, thereby leading to the Agent to
> prosper and the Principal to suffer.
