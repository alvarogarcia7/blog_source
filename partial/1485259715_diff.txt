## The agonizing death of an astronaut

I've read [this article][monad-maybe-javaslang] by Daniel Dietrich on why the implementation of the ``Option`` in Javaslang seems to be broken but, in fact, follows the rules of the monads.

Explains why ``map`` should be used for non-changing contexts and ``flatmap`` should be used for changing it.
