##  Teaching Programming Languages in a Post-Linnaean Age

I've read [this paper][teaching-pls-in-pl-age] by Shriram Krishnamurthi where he explains the need for books like [PLAI][plai]: 

  * lack of paradigms in new languages, and its separation (or lack of)
  * design of languages cheaper and cheaper these days
  * rigor level in publications
  * inductive and deductive learning
  
## Notes  

``post-Linnaean`` refers to the [Carl Linnaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus):
 
  > He is known as the father of modern taxonomy
