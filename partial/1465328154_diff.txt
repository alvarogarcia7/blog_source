## Why Britain banned mobile apps

I've read [this interview][gds-bans-mobile-apps] with Ben Terrett, former design chief at the UK Government Digital Services (GDS), that explains why they prefer webapps rather than native (mobile) apps: it's a matter of cost, having to maintain and update so many mobile versions, versus a single one for the webapp.

Also talks about user research and productagile teams inside the GDS.

The interview is written by Joshua Chambers.
