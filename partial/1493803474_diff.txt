## On Sabbaticals

I've read [this article][sabbaticals] about sabbaticals by Ian Malpass. In it, he explains why we need sabbaticals, how to take them, and some details about them.

Some principles:

> 1. If you think you can’t take a sabbatical, you need to take your sabbatical.
> 1. Day-to-day work pushes us to think tactically; sabbaticals push us to think strategically. Both are valuable.
> 1. Do the work to gain confidence that you can be away, and then trust that that the mechanisms you put in place are good.
> 1. Just because your team can function without you, doesn’t mean they want to.
> 1. There is rarely a good time to leave work for an extended period of time - don’t let this stop you.
> 1. Allow room for serendipity, the unexpected, and exploration.
> 1. Plan for your return before you leave, to avoid worry.
> 1. The sabbatical process doesn’t end after six weeks.
> 1. You don’t have to be unhappy or frustrated in your work to go on sabbatical.
