## Intel x86s hide another CPU that can take over your machine (you can't audit it)

I've read [this article][intel-chipset-inside-chipset] by Damien Zammit on the Intel Management Engine (ME), a hardware system that is embedded in the newer Intel chipsets. Its function is to provide low-level management services. ME (like Active Management Technology [AMT] in the past), provides great services, but has access to any memory location and to the TCP/IP stack, without any control from the operating system.

The firmware is currently checked before booting, but it is highly-valuable as a security risk, as it has full access to the physical hardware.
