## [Language Server Protocol (lsp), rust and Emacs](https://christian.kellner.me/2017/05/31/language-server-protocol-lsp-rust-and-emacs/)

I've read this article by Christian Kellner about a common way of operating with a program's Language Server Protocol (LSP) so all languages could benefit from standard tools. Then, a new editor would just have to implement the bindings to LSP to support those.

Similar to what LLVM is to some languages: once you specify your syntax in terms of LLVM, you can benefit from the improvements that LLVM provides.
