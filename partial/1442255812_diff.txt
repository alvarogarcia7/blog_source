## Lisp is still a secret weapon

I've read [this article][lisp-still-secret-weapon] by Judd Keppel where he explains it is a good idea that Clojure / ClojureScript continues to be a secret, not known among developers. Cites the article 'Beating the averages' by Paul Graham and the amount of available packages in npm, maven central, etc
