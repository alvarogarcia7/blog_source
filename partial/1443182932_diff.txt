## Call me maybe: RabbitMQ

I've read [this article][rabbit-mq-as-lock-service] by Kyle Kingsbury on using RabbitMQ as a lock service. It investigates and gives a counterexample of using it for this purpose.

Uses Knossos to do the testing and surfaces a problem with it. Explains specific problems on locking: at-most-once and at-least-once message delivery

Note: References Jepsen (I guess an inside joke to the song "Call me maybe" by Carly Rae Jepsen) for at-most-once and at-least-once message delivery.
