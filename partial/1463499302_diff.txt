## Advanced Logging with the JavaScript Console

I've watched [this course][js-console-for-power-users] by Mykola Bilokonsky at egghead.io.

In it, he covers the following methods on the console:

```javascript
console.log
console.warn
console.error
console.info
console.debug
```

The amount of parameters does not matter, it will put a space in between. printing an object will print its values

console.log with the C's printf syntax, as long as the first parameter is a string

```javascript
  %o for an object
  %c for CSS
```

```javascript
console.group / groupCollapsed / groupEnd
```
