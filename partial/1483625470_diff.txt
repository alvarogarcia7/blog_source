## Why You Should be Planning for 2018, Not 2017.

I've read [this article][planning-long-term] by Benjamin P. Hardy on motivation, planning and designing your life.

Some quotes:

> [...] having the power to make choices:
> 
> * The right to choice
> * The responsibility to choose
> * The results of choice


> [...] hope reflects your perceptions regarding your capacity to:
> 
> * clearly conceptualize goals
> * develop the specific strategies to reach those goals (i.e., pathways thinking)
> * initiate and sustain the motivation for using those strategies (i.e., agency thinking).


> [...] motivation involves three components:
> 
> * the value you place on your goal
> * your belief that specific behaviors will actually facilitate the outcomes you desire
> * your belief in your own ability to successfully execute the behaviors requisite to achieving your goals
