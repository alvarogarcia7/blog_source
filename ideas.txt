20141223: starting tdd on the refactor phase

pros:
 - can allow for less refactoring at the end of the cycle
 	- not talking about duplication but to refactoring to patterns
 - leave the refactoring to the last responsible moment
 - simplify as no need to reimplement things (that might be a )
cons:
 - speculative development
 - refactoring in wrong places

 boils down to the ROI of the invested time: a later moment means faster time to market now.
