At a client, today we've done a brown-bag session on [Spring Boot][spring-boot-home]: we've gone through the basics with a [sample maven project][sample-maven-project] and its [pom file][sample-pom].

We've seen the [Spring Initializr][spring-initializr] and a live demo, using curl for REST client.
