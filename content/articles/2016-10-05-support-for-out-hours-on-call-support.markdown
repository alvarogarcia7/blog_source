title: Support for out of hours on-call support
---

As the preface for the guide for on-call support, a positive note:

## README

  * You’re cool. I know it. Do not trust yourself, trust me that I trust you.
  * You might be sleepy. It’s OK
  * Everything is going to be fine. Take 5 minutes to think about anything, anytime. Especially before any rash decision.
  * With great power comes great responsibility. Use it wisely.
  * Restoring the services comes first, investigation comes second
  * Do the very minimum of investigation after the incident (collect things that might disappear), leave the rest for the next day on office hours
  * Whenever everything is done, go to sleep but keep an eye on your phone. Someone will contact if necessary

Thanks to [David Hatanian](https://twitter.com/dhatanian) and another colleague for the feedback on this draft.
