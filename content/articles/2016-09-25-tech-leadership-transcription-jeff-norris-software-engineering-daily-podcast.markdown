title: Transcription of podcast: "Tech Leadership with Jeff Norris"
---

The role of a "Tech Lead" is a combination of software engineer, project manager and architect. A Tech Lead might spend 30% of their time coding and 70% of their time managing a project or resolving conflicts or doing planning. In today's episode, we discuss the structure of software teams and when it might make sense to have a tech lead on your team or if it might make sense for you to become a tech lead. And this might be in contrast with a more common team structure of project managers and engineers and engineering managers and, perhaps, qa [quality assurance]. Tech lead is an interesting role because it's more of a combination of several of these roles and I think it speaks to some changing nature of how we do software engineering.

Jeff Norris is an engineer from ThoughtWorks and he joins the show to discuss the idea behind tech leads. This is a great show for anybody interested in managing or who is looking for alternative team structures. I think this episode also appeals to engineers who transition to a role of more variety. If you're like me, I've been an engineer at several companies and I didn't like the idea of writing code all day and I wanted more human interaction so a tech lead would have been an interesting role. So I hope you enjoy this episode.

Jeff Meyerson: Jeff Norris is an engineer at ThoughtWorks, welcome to Software Engineering Daily!

Jeff Norris: Thank you! Welcome.

M: So today we're discussing the position of tech lead and when we talk about software engineering on this show, the roles that we typically discuss are project manager, engineering managers, architects, engineers, maybe qa. I have only started hearing about the role of tech lead more recently. Could you please explain what a tech lead is and how it differs from these other roles in the engineering team?

N: Yeah, so the tech lead is kinda the intersection of three different types of roles. So, first is a leadership: it's about being able to help the team do effective things, be good at things. It's also the intersection of development skills. Finally it's the architecture: it's understanding those three different areas and how they overlap.

M: Now, is it defining difference between a tech lead and these other roles that we've heard about (project manager, architect). Is a defining difference that the tech lead continues to write code?

[4:01]

N: Yes, so if you're not still developing, I don't think it's fair to call yourself a tech lead.

M: Why is that such an important fact?

N: The basic part of it is that -- the way I've heard it described -- the currency of the realm is how effective you are at getting things done and if you're no longer able to write the software that your team is responsible for, it's actually hard to have the respect from the team and be effective at doing it. You want to make decisions based on what's the best for the effectiveness of your system and if you can't actually do the things that your system needs, it's hard to actually know that you're making the right decisions. 

M: So I can agree with that, to a certain extent. Let's take it to a logical extreme that the CEO of the company, for example, Larry Page at Google or should I say Sundar Pichai
