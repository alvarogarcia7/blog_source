title: Transcription of podcast: "Tech Leadership with Jeff Norris"
---

The role of a "Tech Lead" is a combination of software engineer, project manager and architect. A Tech Lead might spend 30% of their time coding and 70% of their time managing a project or resolving conflicts or doing planning. In today's episode, we discuss the structure of software teams and when it might make sense to have a tech lead on your team or if it might make sense for you to become a tech lead. And this might be in contrast with a more common team structure of project managers and engineers and engineering managers and, perhaps, qa [quality assurance]. Tech lead is an interesting role because it's more of a combination of several of these roles and I think it speaks to some changing nature of how we do software engineering.
