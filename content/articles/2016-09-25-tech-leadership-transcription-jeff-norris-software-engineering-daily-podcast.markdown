title: Transcription of podcast: "Tech Leadership with Jeff Norris"
---

The role of a "Tech Lead" is a combination of software engineer, project manager and architect. A Tech Lead might spend 30% of their time coding and 70% of their time managing a project or resolving conflicts or doing planning. In today's episode, we discuss the structure of software teams and when it might make sense to have a tech lead on your team or if it might make sense for you to become a tech lead. And this might be in contrast with a more common team structure of project managers and engineers and engineering managers and, perhaps, qa [quality assurance]. Tech lead is an interesting role because it's more of a combination of several of these roles and I think it speaks to some changing nature of how we do software engineering.

Jeff Norris is an engineer from ThoughtWorks and he joins the show to discuss the idea behind tech leads. This is a great show for anybody interested in managing or who is looking for alternative team structures. I think this episode also appeals to engineers who transition to a role of more variety. If you're like me, I've been an engineer at several companies and I didn't like the idea of writing code all day and I wanted more human interaction so a tech lead would have been an interesting role. So I hope you enjoy this episode.
