title: Alien technology

Main concept:

> What the client has but the client team cannot understand / maintain

Two main kinds: 
  - the creator is the user
  - the creator is not the user

You can also unearth this yourself when you code at your cleverness possibilities (based on the theory that writing code is easier than reading code)

This could be caused by the different mental theories necessary to build the tool. Especially when the alien tool is not created by the user. This does not explain the creation and use by the same person, some time apart. TODO add reference to Naur - Theory building TODO .
