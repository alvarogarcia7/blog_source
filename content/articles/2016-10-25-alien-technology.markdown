title: Alien technology

Main concept:

> What the client has but the client team cannot understand / maintain

Two main kinds: 

  1. the creator is not the user
  1. the creator is the user

Examples (For 1):

  * Someone in your team creates a tool that you do not understand
  * Someone in your team uses a tool that you do not understand

The common topic here is the information silo between them and you. Between those left and those remaining.

Examples (for 2):

  * You created a tool that you do not understand
  * You used a tool that you do not understand

The topic here is the same as before, but can it be attributed to different pools of knowledge? Is there some kind of temporary knowledge that plays a part in this? In this case, I do not agree with the argument that you the creator and you the user are two different people based on the time range that has elapsed.

You can also unearth this yourself when you code at your cleverness possibilities (based on the theory that writing code is easier than reading code)

This could be caused by the different mental theories necessary to build the tool. Especially when the alien tool is not created by the user. This does not explain the creation and use by the same person, some time apart. TODO add reference to Naur - Theory building TODO .
