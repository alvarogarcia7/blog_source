title: Alien technology
---

Main concept:

> What the client has but the client team cannot understand / maintain
> 
> [Pedro M. Santos][pedromsantos]

but can be rephrased as

> What the creator originally created has but the user cannot understand / maintain

Note: both the creator and team can be a single person, a team, a company or, in general, any group of people.

Note: this only applies when the user needs to understand or maintain a solution. Does not apply when the creator performs these tasks. But then the user is in a dependency relationship with the creator.

A bit of this 'alien technology' can help the user advance in their learning process. But too much makes them lose trust in the creator.

Two main kinds: 

  1. the creator is not the user
  1. the creator is the user

Examples (For 1):

  * Someone in your team creates a tool that you do not understand
  * Someone in your team uses a tool that you do not understand

The common topic here is the information silo between them and you. Between those left and those remaining.

Examples (for 2):

  * You created a tool that you do not understand
  * You use a tool that you do not understand

The topic here is the same as before, but can it be attributed to different pools of knowledge? Is there some kind of temporary knowledge that plays a part in this? In this case, I do not agree with the argument that you the creator and you the user are two different people based on the time range that has elapsed.

Creating a tool that later you cannot understand can it be equated to 'debugging code is much more difficult that writing code'

The original is:

> Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?
>
> "The Elements of Programming Style", 2nd edition, chapter 2.
>
> source: [B. Kernighan at WikiQuote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan)

You can also unearth this yourself when you code at your cleverness possibilities (based on the theory that writing code is easier than reading code)


It can also be attributed to Naur's idea.

This could be caused by the different mental theories necessary to build the tool. Especially when the alien tool is not created by the user. This does not explain the creation and use by the same person, some time apart, as the understanding in those two moments are different (more on this topic can be found in [P. Naur, Programming as theory building][naur])
