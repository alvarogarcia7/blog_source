# The importance of a Personal Knowledge Base

We tend to forget about things that happened in the past. This is why we have history books.

We tend to forget about past stock events. This is why have past valuations of companies, plus its news.

We tend to forget what we learn, along our continuous learning process. Where do we store this? Long story short: a Personal Knowledge Base (PKB).

## What is a PKB

A tool to store all of your knowledge, for easy future retrieval. 

TODO Add definition by wikipedia.

## History of a PKB

This is nothing new, as Leonardo da Vinci already had [hundreds of pages of notebooks](http://www.openculture.com/2017/07/leonardo-da-vincis-visionary-notebooks-now-online-browse-570-digitized-pages.html) in the 15th century, now named "The Codex of Arundel".

More recently, Niklas Luhmann (1927â€“1998), Professor of Sociology at the Bielefeld University, generated his own "Filing system" as a "Thinking tool": storing the knowledge in a card-base filing system. Part of the magic of this system is the a) numbering, b) linking, c) indexing.

Nowadays, we have much more powerful tools at our disposal, such as Wiki Technology. In a wiki, you can full-text search (find matches in indexed/non-indexed content), link cards (hyperlink), index, number (i.d., give them an ID).

## Why are we not using PKBs?

Even if the technical tools are so advanced, why are we not creating, retaining, indexing, and remembering more knowledge? 

Some answers to that:

  1. "All the knowledge in the universe is at the tip of our fingers" (TODO find quote source). We believe that we can find the answer to any question out there, in the scale of seconds. While this is true for a) answers we already know the answer for (but cannot recall), b) matters in which we can formulate the appropriate questions.
  1. Information is not the same as knowledge (TODO find quote.) You cannot digest as much knowledge as you can for information. E.g., you can read hundreds of memes on the internet, and enjoy them, but the knowledge that you get out of that is not as much as the information. You need to adhere the new knowledge to your existing knowledge, to make something coherent out of it.
  1. As a society, we have not been (at least, me) told how to store our knowledge for long term preservation, consumption, and storage. Nor how to properly study topics that are not guided by short-term need. TODO add link to 3-buckets of knowledge/study
  1. Technically, it is difficult for a laymen to install, and maintain a PKB in a fashion that is secure, affordable, confidential, available. The easier solution for this is paper notebooks, but these suffer from low reuse (given how difficult it is to search in them, without an index). Also, regarding paper, it is out of fashion to suggest going "back" to paper tools when we have computers.
