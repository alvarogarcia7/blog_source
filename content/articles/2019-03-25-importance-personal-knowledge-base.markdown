# The importance of a Personal Knowledge Base

We tend to forget about things that happened in the past. This is why we have history books.

We tend to forget about past stock events. This is why have past valuations of companies, plus its news.

We tend to forget what we learn, along our continuous learning process. Where do we store this? Long story short: a Personal Knowledge Base (PKB).

## What is a PKB

A tool to store all of your knowledge, for easy future retrieval. 

> A personal knowledge base (PKB) is an electronic tool used to express, capture, and later retrieve the personal knowledge of an individual.
>
> It differs from a traditional database in that it contains subjective material particular to the owner, that others may not agree with nor care about. Importantly, a PKB consists primarily of knowledge, rather than information; in other words, it is not a collection of documents or other sources an individual has encountered, but rather an expression of the distilled knowledge the owner has extracted from those sources.

## History of a PKB

This is nothing new, as Leonardo da Vinci already had [hundreds of pages of notebooks](http://www.openculture.com/2017/07/leonardo-da-vincis-visionary-notebooks-now-online-browse-570-digitized-pages.html) in the 15th century, now named "The Codex of Arundel".

More recently, Niklas Luhmann (1927–1998), Professor of Sociology at the Bielefeld University, generated his own "Filing system" as a "Thinking tool": storing the knowledge in a card-base filing system. Part of the magic of this system is the a) numbering, b) linking, c) indexing.

Other examples include:

  - Vannevar Bush's proposed "memex" system in 1945
  - the collaborative hypertext database ZOG in 1972
  - the NoteCards system from Xerox
  - the Apple hypertext system HyperCard

(These examples have been extracted from [Wikipedia: History of Wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_wikis) )

While these tools are intended for communication between software programmers, you can also choose to communicate with someone in the  future (this is the point of writing). This 'someone' can be a 'future you'.

Nowadays, we have much more powerful tools at our disposal, such as Wiki Technology. In a wiki, you can full-text search (find matches in indexed/non-indexed content), link cards (hyperlink), index, number (i.e., give them an ID).

## Why are we not using PKBs?

Even if the technical tools are so advanced, why are we not creating, retaining, indexing, and remembering more knowledge? 

Some answers to that:

  1. "All the knowledge in the universe is at the tip of our fingers" (TODO find quote source ENDTODO). We believe that we can find the answer to any question out there, in the scale of seconds. While this is true for a) answers we already know the answer for (but cannot recall), b) matters in which we can formulate the appropriate questions.
  1. Information is not the same as knowledge (TODO find quote. ENDTODO) You cannot digest as much knowledge as you can for information. E.g., you can read hundreds of memes on the internet, and enjoy them, but the knowledge that you get out of that is not as much as the information. You need to adhere the new knowledge to your existing knowledge, to make something coherent out of it.
  1. As a society, we have not been (at least, me) told how to store our knowledge for long term preservation, consumption, and storage. Nor how to properly study topics that are not guided by short-term need. TODO add link to 3-buckets of knowledge/study ENDTODO
  1. Technically, it is difficult for a laymen to install, and maintain a PKB in a fashion that is secure, affordable, confidential, available. The easier solution for this is paper notebooks, but these suffer from low reuse (given how difficult it is to search in them, without an index). Also, regarding paper, it is out of fashion to suggest going "back" to paper tools when we have computers.

## The effects of a PKB

  1. > It is visible who knows about this > Ciceri. TODO ask him if we wants to be quoted. ENDTODO
  1. Conversion of more information into knowledge. TODO how to prove this ENDTODO
  1. Ability to store information in non-linear ways. TODO make a reference to Tiddlywiki being non-linear, ZettelKasten being non-linear. ENDTODO. Even if life seems to be linear (along the time axis), we are exposed to information in non-linear waves. E.g., We must pay taxes every year (at least), the needs for information are cyclical. Every time you start a project, the same needs appear. Some information, you will retain in your cerebral memory, some other information can be recalled, some other can be lost forever. TODO find article on importance of losing information, so you can focus on what's important. Also, the inability to lose information does not allow to focus on new one, and is related to some mental illnesses. ENDTODO.
  1. Ability to recall information <de una manera fidel>. We modify information in our brains every time we access a piece of memory, giving a new twist to it. Therefore, you are altering your knowledge every time you use it. Being able to go back a printed/written piece of information, that does not change, allows for <fidel> knowledge recall.
  1. A PKB is a cache, like a L1/L2/L3. The public internet is like a fountain of information, and can be considered a "hard drive" TODO add human scale trips to information ENDTODO. For things that you have already solved, the cache is closer if you can recall what is the key to that information (i.e., the question). The answer lies behind a few clicks when finding the right question. On the other hand, a PKB is a subset of all that information, condensed into knowledge, making it already a smaller size pool of information to search on. Think of a PKB as a L$N$ cache, where the internet is L$M$, where M >> N
  1. Phrased another way, a PKB is a way of storing knowledge for easier retrieval when you need it. It is not information itself, it is not what you have visited, but the "verified" answers you can find on stackoverflow. These verifications are written by yourself
  1. Making an effort to distill your knowledge into written form is already a step to condensate this information into knowledge. TODO add link to "lo hice y lo entendí" blog ENDTODO. TODO add link to studies that analyze how much information is retained from a single reading, study, exam, etc ENDTODO. TODO Add link to Study Smarter, not Harder ENDTODO
  1. PKBs can be shared, imported, analyzed. All of that knowledge needs to be imported into someone else's PKB (aka "digested"), as everyone uses a different domain language.
  1. Knowledge is non-linear, wants to be freed. TODO what. does that mean? ENDTODO

## Tools for a PKB

  - Decide what are your -ilities. TODO add link to evolutionary architectures ENDTODO


### Review of tools

  - Evernote
  - OneNote
  - Google Keep
  - TiddlyWiki

## How to start a PKB

  - You already have lots of knowledge and information running around in your head.
  - Find a way to get them to some place where you can retrieve them later
  -

## My setup

  - I use TiddlyWiki software. TODO Add link ENDTODO
  - It creates a folder where it stores the documents.
  - Documents (aka. Articles), called Tiddlers in the TiddlyWiki nomenclature, can be tagged. This folder contains plain-text documents, that can be backed up, analyzed, treated as plain files. I use git to store revisions of knowledge. Github (private repo) to share my collection.
  - Documents can contain links to other Documents. Also, documents can be linked from inside the wiki via `[PageName]` notation. From outside, they can be linked as well.
  - Documents can be searched in full-text mode
  - Documents can contain images, other attachments
  - Documents have an ID: the name of Tiddler (Document)
  - Many plugins exist for this software.
  - I have created a docker image to run this software locally (mostly for backup purposes). This software can also run in the cloud.


## TODO

 - Remove "nerd/friki" vibe to this article, removing (or, at least, reducing the amount) of references to caches, hard drives
 - Complete all links
 - Remove all TODOs
 - Add necessary "information theory" links/references. Or is it "Computable knowledge" (appears at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base). see article "pauleen2009" doi:10.1108/14684520910951177. A local copy at ~/Document/projects/apiumhub/articles/personal-knowledge-base
 - Complete article
 - Publish
 - publish it in a journal?
 - Tweet about it
 - Create a talk?
