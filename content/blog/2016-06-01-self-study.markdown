## DiversityMediocrityIllusion

I've read this article by [Martin Fowler][DiversityMediocrityIllusion] (on his bliki) about the diversity in conferences and the profession. How it is our job to incentive a positive feedback cycle that brings more diverse people into the workforce.

Explains how they do it in ThoughtWorks and how they have changed in the last decade.

## How sharing other people’s feelings can make you sick

I've read [this article][sharing-feelings-empathy] by Emma Young on how being empathic to others can make you sick on their own illness. How illness can be socially transmitted, by loved ones or even by strangers.

How algorithms (that display news) can affect your own well-being and how this is reduced by using compassion instead of empathy.

Borders on the difference of empathy vs compassion.

## Advanced Logging with the JavaScript Console

I've watched [this course][js-console-for-power-users] by Mykola Bilokonsky at egghead.io.

In it, he covers the following methods on the console:

```javascript
console.log
console.warn
console.error
console.info
console.debug
```

The amount of parameters does not matter, it will put a space in between. printing an object will print its values

console.log with the C's printf syntax, as long as the first parameter is a string

```javascript
  %o for an object
  %c for CSS
```

```javascript
console.group / groupCollapsed / groupEnd
```

## Expert Resumé Driven Development

I've read [this article][expert-rdd] by Tariq Ali, where he explains the Resume-Driven Development, as a subset of the Principal-Agent Problem:

> The Principal (management) hires an Agent (a developer) to build a program and
> allow the Agent to choose the tech stack. But the Agent's interest (making his resumé
> more impressive) can be orthogonal to the Principal's interest (producing a great
> product by using the "right tool" for the job). If the Principal allows the Agent to
> do as he wish, then the Agent will do as he wishes, thereby leading to the Agent to
> prosper and the Principal to suffer.

## Resume Driven Development

I've read [this article][rdd] by  Mike Loukides about the problem of finding a technical person based on CVs and the [Law of the instrument][law-instrument]:

>  [...] the inability of a technical team to specify what they really want
>  (a developer with good programming taste and instincts), and
>  instead hiring someone who has a particular skill or credential [...]

## Why Britain banned mobile apps

I've read [this interview][gds-bans-mobile-apps] with Ben Terrett, former design chief at the UK Government Digital Services (GDS), that explains why they prefer webapps rather than native (mobile) apps: it's a matter of cost, having to maintain and update so many mobile versions, versus a single one for the webapp.

Also talks about user research and productagile teams inside the GDS.

The interview is written by Joshua Chambers.

## 360 million reasons to destroy all passwords

I've read [this article][destroy-all-passwords] by Quincy Larson about the insecurity of passwords, both managed by vaults (like LastPass) or remembered ones. They all are susceptible to being discovered, leaked or shared to other sites / accounts.

The author suggests to use passwordless login, which sends a link to your email account, which allows you to log in to the application

## Compilers as Assistants

I've read [this article][compilers-assistant] by Evan Czaplicki on seeing the compiler as an assistant to your work, instead of an adversary. Of how the compiler should give the most useful errors and warnings.

He also explains what features have been removed from the Elm language in 0.16.

## Craftsmanship, design, and code

I've read [this article][craftsmanship-design-and-code] by Jonathan Z. White about the relation between design and code and what craftsmanship is about. 

Suggests learning more about the counterpart (design vs code), to better understand the activity of creating software as a whole. For developers, suggests a few activities to improve (e.g., read better code, write unit tests, analyze code). Cites that the only way of measuring progress is comparing where you are today compared to some time ago.

## Intel x86s hide another CPU that can take over your machine (you can't audit it)

I've read [this article][intel-chipset-inside-chipset] by Damien Zammit on the Intel Management Engine (ME), a hardware system that is embedded in the newer Intel chipsets. Its function is to provide low-level management services. ME (like Active Management Technology [AMT] in the past), provides great services, but has access to any memory location and to the TCP/IP stack, without any control from the operating system.

The firmware is currently checked before booting, but it is highly-valuable as a security risk, as it has full access to the physical hardware.
