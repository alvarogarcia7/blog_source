## Until the End of the Internet

I've read [this article][until-end-internet] by Jason Zimdars explaining the "end of the internet" policy at Basecamp: they will make everything possible to keep the services running for existing customer until the end or until the last customer uses it.

 ## How Agile Principles Can Fund Your Start-Up

 I've read [this article][agile-funding-startup] by Jurgen Appelo explaining how the agile values can help you negotiate funding for your startup: instead of negotiating with each investor, agree on a formula and invest in many small rounds, instead of a big one. This works both ways: for buying and for selling.

 Suggests using a base plus the amount of sales in the last year * a percentage.
