## How Agile Principles Can Fund Your Start-Up

 I've read [this article][agile-funding-startup] by Jurgen Appelo explaining how the agile values can help you negotiate funding for your startup: instead of negotiating with each investor, agree on a formula and invest in many small rounds, instead of a big one. This works both ways: for buying and for selling.

 Suggests using a base plus the amount of sales in the last year * a percentage.

I've read [this article][scaling-agile-paradoxes] by Giovanni Asproni about agile.

>
>Second paradox of scaling: Projects fulfilling the prerequisites for scaling have a lesser need to scale.
