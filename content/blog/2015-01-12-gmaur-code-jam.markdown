title: 'GMaur code jam 2015: 01 - Mini-Power Swapper'

---

Last year we started the program 12 months, 12 katas (as inspired by this [repository](https://github.com/12meses12katas)). This year we want to propose something different: an asynchronous code jam

##New problem: Mini-Power Swapper

This post belongs to a series: [code-jam](/{{< category "code-jam" >}}/)

Each month (or so) we at GMaur will publish a new problem (and announce it on [twitter](https://twitter.com/gmaurcom)) and post a solution to the last problem.

This month, the [Mini-Power Swapper](https://github.com/GMaur/code-jam-2015/tree/master/problem-01)

You can fork the repo, commit there and send a pull request. We'll review the code (if you want) and merge the solution to a branch in "solutions/".

Happy katas and happy code jamming!
