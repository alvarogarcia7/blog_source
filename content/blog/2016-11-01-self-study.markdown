## Advice for white men

I've read [this article][adv-white-men] by Cate Huston about how advice affects different people.

>But here are some things to consider:
>
>  - Advice on failure is different for people who are judged on performance rather than potential.
>  - Advice on saying no is different for people who aren’t appreciated for doing work for the collective… but who are punished if they don’t.
>  - Advice on negotiation is different for people who are perceived negatively when they do negotiate.
>  - Advice on choosing a new job is different for people who disproportionately experience harassment (it’s another factor to consider).
>  - Advice on raising your profile is different for people who are recognized for their advocacy more than their work.
