## Advice for white men

I've read [this article][adv-white-men] by Cate Huston about how advice affects different people.

>But here are some things to consider:
>
>  - Advice on failure is different for people who are judged on performance rather than potential.
>  - Advice on saying no is different for people who aren’t appreciated for doing work for the collective… but who are punished if they don’t.
>  - Advice on negotiation is different for people who are perceived negatively when they do negotiate.
>  - Advice on choosing a new job is different for people who disproportionately experience harassment (it’s another factor to consider).
>  - Advice on raising your profile is different for people who are recognized for their advocacy more than their work.

## On 1:1s

I've read [this article][on-one-on-ones] by Cate Huston about one-on-ones (1:1s), that includes how she handles and the purpose of them.

> For me, 1:1s were about active relationship building, with a focus on the important-but-not urgent. But having built a relationships where we talked regularly and I listened, that created space for conversations to happen outside of the 1:1

## Purely Functional I/O

I've watched [this talk][functional-io] by Runar Bjarnason on purely functional IO. In the first part, he introduces functional programming, referential transparency and functional IO. In the second part, he explains the types for IO and both the implementation in haskell and in scala.

## 3.a The Tao of Monad

I've read [this article][tao-of-monad] by Bartosz Milewski explaining the Monad under another lens.

He draws some inspiration from Lao Tzu, in Tao Te Ching: TE as virtue, laziness.
