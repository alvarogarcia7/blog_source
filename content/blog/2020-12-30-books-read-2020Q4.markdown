Read this quarter:

  * 12 rules for life; Peterson; own-it, non-technical, philosophy


## 12 rules for life

The book contains some rules, some principles to remove doubt and uncertainty from life.

There are plenty of mentions to the Bible, although I consider the book to the secular in its contents.

There are few personal stories on the book (e.g., about his daughter Mikhaila Peterson), which makes it readable and enjoyable. The philosophy behind it is sometimes not-politically-correct. 

For each of the rules, he has a setup of "introduction - main - conclusion".

From wikipedia [0]:
