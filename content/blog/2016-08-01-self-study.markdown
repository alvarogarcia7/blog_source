## Are Semicolons Necessary in JavaScript?

I've watched [this video][semicolons-in-js] by Kyle Robinson Young on whether semicolons are necessary in javascript and why he purposely does not use them, to teach people how to do it. Suggests going for a month with the opposite way (write / don't write) to see how it feels and take an informed decision.
