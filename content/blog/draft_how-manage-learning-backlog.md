## Introduction

Given that learning is also an economic art --described as having unlimited topics to learn, while having limited resouces for learning TODO add source--, we must find a way to manage that study time accordingly.

I believe we already have a way of managing it, whether you know it or not: the way you currently do it. Even not doing it, this is a policy as well. This article tries to explain which is my policy for studying and learning.

## Values

I value simplicity, over perfection in choosing the right learning bit.

I value learning something, rather than over-analyzing what to study.

My time for study is limited, therefore I prefer to invest it in studying rather than managing my studies.

## On managing your learning

TODO add link to 'Buckets of learning'.

Learning can be about a specific topic, general area. You will spend more time learning about these topics and areas, than learning about a specific resource. This is based on the definition: an area includes several topics, a topic includes several resources.

To see how topics relate to each other, we can draw a mind map (TODO add link to mind map) including them.

Given that we have finite resources to infinite desires, we must allocate our resources effectively. This is where keeping a learning backlog can be useful.

## The learning backlog

### What's a backlog?

In this particular case, not all work will be completed in finite time, which is equivalent to saying that not all work will be completed. Some of it will be unfinished, go stale (or not), and be removed from the backlog. 

### Adding items

### Expiring items

I have no definitive answer on how to clean your backlog, but you can get inspiration based on the 'weekly review' practice from Getting Things Done (GTD) TODO add link.

There should be one and only one 'next task' in your backlog. Always have that clear, to remove the uncertainty of 'which is the next task'. That uncertainty can lead to analysis-paralisis.

The closer to the top, the more refined your items are. Conversely, the closer to the bottom, more uncertain, more foggy items become.

Let's see an example (top to bottom):

  * LEA-1: Epic: Learn about operations. Goal: deploy my code more often, fluently, better, using everyday tools
  * LEA-2: Item: [LEA-1] Investigate deployment tools (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure)
  * LEA-6: Item: [LEA-1] Investigate AWS deployment tools
  * LEA-7: Item: [LEA-1] Investigate git hooks
  * ...
  * LEA-4: Epic: Learn about REST API design's HATEOAS
  * LEA-9: Epic: Learn about serverless

At the top, the Epics are better defined, more thorough. The more you descend on the backlog, the epics are less defined, more nebulous. At the end, they might become mere ideas to investigate later on. I do that investigation in 'refinement' sessions, based on knowledge I gather along the way, asking people around, etc.


## On buying books (and other resources)

I postpone buying the book (and other resources) until the moment I really need it. This helps preventing tsundoku (TODO add link). This is related to the 'delaying gratification' / 'cold list' (TODO Add link).

## On keeping your learning at hand

I find it fundamental to lowering the barriers to helpful habits: it's much more cumbersome to have to go to the library if I have time to study now, rather than getting the ebook from my bag.

I keep with me a couple of books to be read at all times, and usually carry my e-reader with me. When I'm not carrying it, I can read (a book/an article) from the phone.

There are times when you are in the mood for discovering resources, and others in which you are more for studying those resources. Use that inclination accordingly, to make the most of your time.
