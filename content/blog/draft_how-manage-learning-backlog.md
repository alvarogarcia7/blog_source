## Introduction

Given that learning is also an economic art --described as having unlimited topics to learn, while having limited resouces for learning TODO add source--, we must find a way to manage that study time accordingly.

I believe we already have a way of managing it, whether you know it or not: the way you currently do it. Even not doing it, this is a policy as well. This article tries to explain which is my policy for studying and learning.

## Values

I value simplicity, over perfection in choosing the right learning bit.

I value learning something, rather than over-analyzing what to study.

My time for study is limited, therefore I prefer to invest it in studying rather than managing my studies.

## On buying books (and other resources)

I postpone buying the book (and other resources) until the moment I really need it. This helps preventing tsundoku (TODO add link). This is related to the 'delaying gratification' / 'cold list' (TODO Add link).

## On keeping it at hand

I find it fundamental to lowering the barriers to helpful habits: it's much more cumbersome to have to go to the library if I have time to study now, rather than getting the ebook from my bag.

I keep with me a couple of books to be read at all times, and usually carry my e-reader with me. When I'm not carrying it, I can read (a book/an article) from the phone.

There are times when you are in the mood for discovering resources, and others in which you are more for studying those resources. Use that inclination accordingly, to make the most of your time.
