title: CAS2014 Wrap up
url: /2014/12/08/cas2014-wrap-up/
---

This year's edition of the CAS 2014 has been awesome. There were several tracks:

 * Enterprise Agile
 * Collaboration, Culture and Teams
 * Delighting Products
 * Agile+
 * Development Practices and Craftsmanship

The last one is where I spent most of the time.

The schedule
----------

 The first day:

 * [Sandro Mancuso][sandro]: talking about Software Craftsmanship
 * [Jose Manuel Armesto][armesto]: talking about Unit Testing sucks (and it's our fault)
 * [Rubén Martín Pozo][rmarpozo]: talking about Specification by example - Historia de un equipo que no odia documentar
 * [Xavi Gost][xavigost]: talking about La economía del refactoring. Una visión desde la gestión económica del proyecto.
 * [Pedro Gustavo Torres][pedro]: talking about Pair Programming

 The second day:
 
 * [Rafael de Castro][rafa]: talking about Generando tests
 * [Ricardo Borillo][borillo]: talking about CQRS y los beneficios surgidos de la necesidad.
 * [Manu Cupcic][manu] and [Adrian Perreau de Pinninck][adrian]: talking about Delivery at Scale.
 * [Juan Gabardini][jgabardini]: talking about Testing en equipos infectados de test. This talk was also prepared by Juan Diego Vasco Moncada but he couldn't come.

 Some thoughts
 ----------

 The conferences were awesome, but I'd preferred if most (if not all) were in English so this conference can attract more international speakers

 There were 600+ people in the [CCCB](http://www.cccb.org/). That was only possible due to all the volunteers, organizers, caterers and the assistants.
