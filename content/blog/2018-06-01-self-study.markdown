## [PASSWORD SECURITY ALERT](https://blog.8tracks.com/2017/06/27/password-security-alert/)

I've read this article by David Porter in which they alert their users that their database has been leaked, therefore some passwords are at risk.

The passwords were hashed and salted, not stored in plain text, but those who share a password across services could be at risk.

The attack has been successful given that a developer didn't have two-factor authentication (2FA) on their github account and the company was using GitHub LFS (git large file system) to store database backups

There are two different groups of things in the list: things you are/have (skills) and things you do (actitudes). On the former, writing code (good, business code that is correctly organized, architected, designed), to know a lot. On the latter, ownership for the project (implication, care), teaching and learning from others.

## [Don’t Know What You Want? Improve These 7 Universal Skills](Self-Discipline: Get better at ignoring the negative voice in your head. Get out of your bed. Go to the gym. Don’t listen to “I don’t want to.”)

Personal Effectiveness: Learn how to maximize the results you can get during the 16–18 hours you’re awake. Get more done — effectively.
Communication: We think we’re all master communicators. But the truth is that we suck. Communication is both art and science. And our ability to work with others depends on it.
Negotiation: You negotiate all the time. With your spouse, kids, parents, teachers, friends, co-workers, managers, etc. Learn to get the best deal for all parties.
Persuasion: Learn how to get what you want in an ethical way.
Physical Strength & Stamina: Getting stronger is a skill. Pull your own weight. It’s something every human should be able to do.
Flexibility: Sitting all day long behind your computer or in your car turns you into a stiff being. Learn how to stretch your hips, lower back, hamstrings, and calves — the most common weak points of desk workers.

## [The Great Attention Heist](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-great-attention-heist/)

I've read this article by John Bell, John Zada on the current war for attention, what they call the 'attention heist': publishers fight for your attention, selling it to third parties. The more they can lure you to spend your (finite) attention with them, the higher the profits.

They talk about two kinds of attention: short span and long span. Reading news is the first while reading a book or a long article is the second one.

They mention unplugging (i.e., a "digital sabbath") to help improving the level of concentration

(this was a book review, of 'The attention merchants', by Tim Wu)

I've read this self-help article on how to help yourself by doing hard things:

> Start letting go of unnecessary ideals
> Start putting your heart and soul into the things you do
> Start stretching yourself just beyond the edge of comfort
> Start taking more deep breaths, so you can mindfully collect more lessons for the long run
> Start side-stepping senseless drama
> Start staying true to your values and convictions
> Start looking for silver linings
> Start focusing inward more often
> Start embracing your humanness and giving yourself more credit
> Start taking the next small, insignificant step (one at a time, every day).

## [Cognitive Biases in Programming](https://hackernoon.com/cognitive-biases-in-programming-5e937707c27b)

I've read this article that explains some cognitive biases (prejudices of our mind) while programming:

1. Hyperbolic Discounting: Going for an immediate payoff instead of a delayed larger one
1. IKEA Effect:Overvaluing your own solutions to a problem, and thus in contrast undervalue other solutions. Also called the "Not-Invented-Here (NIH) Syndrome"
1. Premature Optimization: Optimizing before you know that you need to.
1. Planning Fallacy: Optimistically underestimating the time required to complete a task
1. Recency Bias: Placing higher value on recent events than ones that occurred further in the past

> We can never completely eliminate our biases, by being aware of how it is affecting us, we can somewhat mitigate the problems it causes.

## [To type or not to type: quantifying detectable bugs in JavaScript](https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/09/19/to-type-or-not-to-type-quantifying-detectable-bugs-in-javascript/)

I've read this paper commentary by Adrian Colyer (on a paper by Zheng Gao, Christian Bird, Earl T. Barr) on a study that tries to reproduce fixes for defects based on the dynamic to static typing system. 

>  both Flow and TypeScript are pretty good, and conservatively either of them can prevent about 15% of the bugs that end up in committed code.

It's interesting to see these effects quantified: 

> Running the binomial test on the results shows that, at the confidence level of 95%, the true percentage of detectable bugs for Flow and TypeScript falls into [11.5%, 18.5%] with mean 15%.

Also, some recommendations for the future: for typescript and flow to be compatible for more gains.

I've read this article by Rebecca Holman explaining what is a work spouse (i.e., a trusted equal to bounce off ideas, discuss, advance together). Not a mentor, not a trusted boss, not someone reporting to you.

Explains some of the benefits of finding that role.

## [Compare your efforts: 30 vs 3000 LOC for very simple MEAN app](http://blog.allcountjs.com/post/128771961651/compare-efforts)

I've read this article that explains the difference between business value and technical value: a feature for the business could be very valuable but technically costly; also the other way around: they are independent variables.

Also explains that some value in development can be obtained quicker by using a framework, such as the tool that allcountjs provides: 30 lines to generate the equivalent business features to 3000 lines

## [SE-Radio Episode 273: Steve McConnell on Software Estimation](http://www.se-radio.net/2016/11/se-radio-episode-273-steve-mcconnell-on-software-estimation/)

Sven Johann interviews Steve McConnell about software estimation and planning.

Talks about intrinsic risk management and extrinsic risk management

Explains that you should manage the risk so the most uncertain is tackled in the beginning. At the retro (following the demo), you get risk identification (as root cause analysis based on not delivering as expected)

> The goal of Agile was not to be able to change all the time, but to adapt to change



> Embrace change

## [The pleasure of building big things](http://rc3.org/2015/03/24/the-pleasure-of-building-big-things/)

I've read this article explaining that big projects take time to be created.

The temptation is all around us, to accelerate feedback loops, create products more quickly, release earlier. That has the tension of being 'half-baked' products, that have not achieved the minimum level of loveable feature and, thus, not used.
