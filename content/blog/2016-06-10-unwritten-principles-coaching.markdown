A quote from [Reinventing Organizations][reinventing-organizations],
about a few unwritten principles for coaching, in Chapter 2.2: 
Self-management (structures), page 70:

>  * It’s okay for teams to struggle. From struggle comes learning. And
> teams that have gone through difficult moments build resilience
> and a deep sense of community. The coach’s role therefore is not
> to prevent foreseeable problems, but to support teams in solving
> them (and later help them reflect on how they’ve grown in the
> process).
>  * The coach’s role is to let teams make their own choices, even if she
> believes she knows a better solution.
>  * The coach supports the team mostly by asking insightful questions
> and mirroring what she sees. She helps teams frame issues and
> solutions in light of [the company’s] purpose and its holistic approach
> to care.
>  * The starting point is always to look for enthusiasm, strengths, and
> existing capabilities within the team. The coach projects trust that
> the team has all it takes to solve the problems it faces. 
>
