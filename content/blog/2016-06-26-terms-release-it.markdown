  * mixed workload: is a combination of different transaction types processed by a system.
  * system: the complete, interdependent set of hardware, applications, and services required to process transactions for users

  * stress (to the system): is a force applied to the system over an extended period.
  * impulse: is a rapid shock to the system.
