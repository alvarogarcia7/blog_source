## [How your startup can survive technical debt](https://andreschweighofer.com/tech/how-your-startup-can-survive-technical-debt/)

Mentions the paradox of success: you need debt to start quickly, yet too quickly leaves no time to pay debt. Hence your prototype turns into an MVP, and that is your first piecce of technical debt.

## [The Eternal Novice Trap](https://www.feoh.org/the-eternal-novice-trap.html)

> * Do learn new programming languages and paradigms, but learn them from a place of confidence and mastery with your primary tool of choice.
> * Don’t fall for the trap of perpetually chasing after the bright shiny thing that’s hot right now. Recognize that what’s new isn’t necessarily better. Take what will meaningfully help you advance your career and let the rest flow by. There’ll always be more tomorrow.
> * Do keep having fun! You’ll learn more quickly and retain more if you’re finding enjoyment in what you do. Sometimes it means looking at things a little differently, but often that open mindedness can pay off.
