## [How I ended up paying $150 for a single 60GB download from Amazon Glacier](https://medium.com/@karppinen/how-i-ended-up-paying-150-for-a-single-60gb-download-from-amazon-glacier-6cb77b288c3e)

I've read this article by Marko Karppinen that explains how a mistake in understanding the pricing model of AWS Glacier cost 150$ instead of the expected 0.86$

> When cloud providers use uncommon and/or unpredictable pricing models, even your informed hunch about the cost can be off by several orders of magnitude, like the price differential between an iPad and a Ferrari.
>
> The only way to avoid this is by reading, very carefully, through the laughably long passages of meandering technical trivia that constitute the Glacier FAQ or, indeed, this Medium post.

## [Why weâ€™re betting against real-time team messaging ](https://blog.doist.com/why-were-betting-against-real-time-team-messaging-521804a3da09)

I've read this article by Amir Salihefendic on why they have created a tool for online async communication, where the online presence icon is disabled and communications happen around threads.

Trying to transform the online (from real-time to async) communications to leave spaces for deep work.
