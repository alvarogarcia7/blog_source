This quarter I've focused my efforts on a mix of everything:

  - business books: Traction, The Goal
  - philosophy: Stoicism and personal philosophy
  - some finance: classic: Malkiel, personal finance: Robin
  - some classic psychology: Frankl
  - a classic novel: The Metamorphosis (Kafka)

Read this quarter:

  * Hombre en busca del sentido, el; Frankl; own-it, non-technical
  * Metamorfosis; Kafka; own-it, non-technical
  * Your money or your life; Dominguez, Robin; non-technical, finance, own-it
  * Traction; Wickman; own-it, non-technical
  * How to Be a Stoic: Using Ancient Philosophy to Live a Modern Life; Pigliucci; own-it, non-technical

  * Goal, the; Goldratt (+); own-it
  * Random walk down wall street a; Malkiel [Parts I, II, III]; own-it

Note: re+read means I'm re-reading this book. The (+) stands for one-or-more times, as in the regexes.

Note: As a curiosity, I've added 30 books to the queue in this quarter, while only reading 8. So the list will naturally grow over time.

## El hombre en busca del sentido; Frankl (Man's Search for Meaning)

In this book, Viktor Frankl relates his experiences and learning at the concentration camp.

> One of Frankl's main claims in the book is that a positive attitude was essential to surviving the camps. Consequently, he implied that those who died had given up
>
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_Search_for_Meaning#Reception

## Metamorfosis; Kafka

> The Metamorphosis tells the story of salesman Gregor Samsa who wakes one morning to find himself inexplicably transformed into a huge insect and subsequently struggling to adjust to this new condition
>
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis


## Your money or your life; Dominguez, Robin

This book is split in two parts:

  * Introduction to its philosophy
  * Practical advice for implementing said philosophy

### Philosophy

In the first part, the authors give your a framework for computing your real hourly wage: (salary - expenses) / (work time\*). where:
   - salary: net income from your job/employment
   - expenses: monetary expenses needed to maintain said job (e.g., car to commute to work, work clothing, work lunches)
   - work time\*: hours of work + hours of everything related to work (e.g., commuting, shopping for work clothing, rest time when you are very stressed at work)

They explain the importance of doing the things that motivate us, that bring a positive impact to society and to the world

## Traction; Wickman

Recommended by Evgeny Predein, who runs Apiumhub following the advice from this book.

A book report can be found [here](https://www.cmiteamwork.com/documents/BookReport-Traction.pdf)

## How to Be a Stoic: Using Ancient Philosophy to Live a Modern Life; Pigliucci

In this book, which was published after _Guide to the Good Life (Irvine)_, there a few twists to this other referenced book.

Has many examples of how the author lives his life according to this philosophy.

Explains the history of Stoicism (from the Stoa Poikile - the painted Stoa [stoa = portico, porch]).

## Guide to the Good Life, The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy, a; Irvine; non-technical

Explains the concept of personal philosophy of life. That it is more important to have one than to have the correct one. That many people don't have one, don't even know this concept and go their whole lives without wondering if such thing exists.

Tries to adapt the ancient Stoic philosophy to the modern environment. There are a few twists to the Greek & Roman setups (the Greeks mostly valued virtue, the Romans mostly valued tranquility)

Explains the Stoic virtues, some exercises.

## Goal, the; Goldratt (+)

Recommended by Evgeny Predein.

> A management-oriented novel [...]
>
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_(novel)

The main goal of this novel is to teach using the Socratic method. The authors believe this is a good setup for practicing this concept. It also appears inside the novel, when the wife of the main character also references the Socractic dialogues.

In the introduction, the authors also try to explain the purpose of the book: doing science - coming up with hypotheses, experimenting, validating/invalidating them.

Introduces the concept of the mentor (in the form of a hippie business consultant), for someone who is not available all the time, who aims to provide tips for change itself, rather than making the change.

This book has inspired 'The Phoenix Project' (which I also read in the past).

## Random walk down wall street a; Malkiel [Parts I, II, III]

(notes from 2019-03-23)

This is a practical guide to understanding finances at an amateur investor level.

Explains concepts such as:

  - Efficient Market Theory (EMT)
  - Capital-Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
  - Beta (systematic risk from CAPM) and unsystematic risk
  - Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)
  - Technical and Fundamental Analysis
  - Castles-in-the-air vs Firm-Foundation Theories

Explains the background to the current investment scenario: the bubbles, the analysts, the conflicts of interest.

All of that in readable prose, well-connected story.

Also provides a practical guide for the investor, mostly targeted at the US investor (e.g., IRA, Roth IRA, 529s, 401(k))

Spoiler: a random walk is defined as a path in which the next step (to be taken) bears no relationship to the past. This is what the author suggests in relation to the stock prices.
