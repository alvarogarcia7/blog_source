## [How the Clipboard Works, Part 1](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ntdebugging/2012/03/16/how-the-clipboard-works-part-1/)

I've read this article, by Matt Burrough, on how the clipboard works on windows.

Explains how the API works and how the different formats and priorities are organized so the new application can decide which format to accept.
