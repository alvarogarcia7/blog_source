Specifically the chapter no. 20 ("Listening to the tests") from [Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/) available [here](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321503627/ref=as_sl_pd_tf_lc?tag=httpwwwm3pcou-20&camp=213381&creative=390973&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=0321503627&adid=12B4KPA3REF515ASAZN8&&ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.growing-object-oriented-software.com%2F) is so good to learn to hear to your tests.

To hear what they're trying to tell you, the authors ([Steve Freeman](https://twitter.com/sf105) and [Nat Pryce](https://twitter.com/natpryce)) explain this to you:

 * I Need to Mock an Object I Can’t Replace
 * Logging Is a Feature
 * Mocking Concrete Classes
 * Don’t Mock Values
 * Bloated Constructor
 * Confused Object
 * Too Many Dependencies
 * Too Many Expectations


To close, a quote:

> [...] We’ve found that the qualities that make an object easy to test also make our code responsive to change
