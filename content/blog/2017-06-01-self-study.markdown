## You’re Too Busy. You Need a ‘Shultz Hour.’

I've read [this article][shultz-hour] by David Leonhardt, about the Shultz Hour: time set aside to not be busy, so you can set aside the tactical topics and focus on the strategic topics.

> “You waste years by not being able to waste hours.”
>
> Amos Tversky  (as Michael Lewis describes in his THE UNDOING PROJECT)

## Why the 8-Hour Workday Doesn't Work

I've read [this article][hour-workday-8] defending the removal of the 8-hour workday, preferring the division of time in slots.
In the article, 52 minutes of highly focused work then 17 minutes of rest. 

The key idea is the work-rest, no matter how big those slots are.

Gives tips on how to separate both, some other tips for improving your performance.
