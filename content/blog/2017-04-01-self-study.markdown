## Gerald Weinberg on Bugs, Errors, and Software Quality

I've listened to [this interview][bug-error-weinberg] with Gerald Weinberg where he first talks about software quality, defining a fault, failure, a boo-boo, a blunder (below). Then, they move on to the cost of quality, experiences in his project 'Mercury' (a man in orbit; his contribution was on the software side). Says it's one of his first projects where a person's life was directly related to a piece of software.

Fault: wrong operation in code
Failure: user's experience caused by a fault
Boo-boo: a one-off, small failure. Usually shrugged as a small defect
Blunder: a one-off, big failure. Can kill a career

About the cost of software, he mentions that many managers are not willing to pay the price of almost defect-free software and that this level of quality is not required in every project. This idea is similar to the one 'Testing every part is akin to reading every letter on the newspaper: one parts are more important than other'.

This interview talks about similar topics than 'Why programs fail', especially about the definition.

At the end of the interview, he talks about team-based software development (~XP) and an anecdote about a company he was consulting with: follow the process or pay the defects out of your own pocket. One of them, accepted paying for defects, until he made a big mistake. Accepted training the rest of the employees into his very precise methods and became very valuable to the company.

## Bored People Quit

I've read [this article][bored-quit] by Michael Lopp on what are some mechanisms why bored people quit.

Some interesting quotes:

> My gig is the care and feeding of engineers, and their productivity is my productivity. If they all leave, I have exactly no job.

> My job isnâ€™t just building product; I also build people.
