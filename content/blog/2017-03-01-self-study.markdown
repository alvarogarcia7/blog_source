## ¿Volver?

I've read [this article][volver] by Raul Avila comparing the options between working in the UK and in Spain (where he's originally from). Inspired by other professionals (e.g., David Bonilla, Jerónimo Palacios).

## On Sabbaticals

I've read [this article][sabbaticals] about sabbaticals by Ian Malpass. In it, he explains why we need sabbaticals, how to take them, and some details about them.

Some principles:

> 1. If you think you can’t take a sabbatical, you need to take your sabbatical.
> 1. Day-to-day work pushes us to think tactically; sabbaticals push us to think strategically. Both are valuable.
> 1. Do the work to gain confidence that you can be away, and then trust that that the mechanisms you put in place are good.
> 1. Just because your team can function without you, doesn’t mean they want to.
> 1. There is rarely a good time to leave work for an extended period of time - don’t let this stop you.
> 1. Allow room for serendipity, the unexpected, and exploration.
> 1. Plan for your return before you leave, to avoid worry.
> 1. The sabbatical process doesn’t end after six weeks.
> 1. You don’t have to be unhappy or frustrated in your work to go on sabbatical.

## Three Common Mistakes of the First Time Tech Lead

I've read [this article][mistakes-tech-lead] by Patrick Kua, in which he explains what are the anti-patterns (or mistakes) of a tech lead. They do not only apply to first timers, but more experienced ones as well.

I especially like a comment:

> Take all blame and give all credit: I ensure I always take the blame from the stakeholders when something is broken but when they praise, I say its all my teams efforts and I am just guiding them.

## The myth of using Scala as a better Java

I've read [this article][scala-as-better-java] by Denis Kalinin disproving 'Java as a better Scala'. He covers dependency injection, database access, serialization.

## The eigenvector of "Why we moved from language X to language Y"

I've read [this article][moved-from-x-to-y] by Erik Bern on the statistical analysis (based on people writing blog posts) of moving from language X to language Y.

This can help predict which languages will be more prevalent in the future.

## The key lesson from our serverless migration

I've read [this article][serverless-migration] by Gojko Adzic on serverless, a kind of lessons learned. Explains that their system can take 50% more users at 50% of the original cost.

Also explains three ways of authenticating users: use IAM users, use Cognito, pre-sign URLs

## When automation goes horribly wrong

I've read this article by Gojko Adzic on a story of a manual process that was automated.

> Because it focused too much on replacing humans instead of assisting them, MiDAS actually made it more difficult for clerks to access the data they needed for review

This reminded me of the framework vs library discussion:

  * in frameworks you relinquish the control, putting your code into the allocated holes.
  * using the automated system, you can only check the claim at a certain spot, where the system lets you do.

The system and the framework have been designed to take control of the situation. Both successful at what they do

## Meeting policy

I've read [this article][meeting-policy-ueno] by the Ueno team on how they handle meetings. Interesting that they require manager approval for meetings over a certain threshold (more than four people or more than half an hour).

## A Brief History of Random Numbers

I've read [this article][history-rn] by Carl Tashian on how random numbers have evolved (from dice to pseudo random number generator and random number generators). Explain how some companies that need true randomness (e.g., certificates company) generate them.

## Unlock honest feedback with this one word

I've read [this article][honest-feedback-advice] by Claire Lew, in which she suggests to ask for 'advice' instead of asking for 'feedback' as a way of getting more honest and better responses.

## Gerald Weinberg on Bugs, Errors, and Software Quality

I've listened to this interview with Gerald Weinberg where he first talks about software quality, defining a fault, failure, a boo-boo, a blunder (below). Then, they move on to the cost of quality, experiences in his project 'Mercury' (a man in orbit; his contribution was on the software side). Says it's one of his first projects where a person's life was directly related to a piece of software.

Fault: wrong operation in code
Failure: user's experience caused by a fault
Boo-boo: a one-off, small failure. Usually shrugged as a small defect
Blunder: a one-off, big failure. Can kill a career

About the cost of software, he mentions that many managers are not willing to pay the price of almost defect-free software and that this level of quality is not required in every project. This idea is similar to the one 'Testing every part is akin to reading every letter on the newspaper: one parts are more important than other'.

This interview talks about similar topics than 'Why programs fail', especially about the definition.

## Microservice Practitioners with Austin Gunter and Richard Li

I've listened to this podcast at Software Engineering Daily with Austin Gunter and Richard Li. In it, they talk about how they have organized the conference 'Microservice Practicitioners': how to find speakers, the vibes of the conference, etc.
