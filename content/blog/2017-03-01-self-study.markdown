## ¿Volver?

I've read [this article][volver] by Raul Avila comparing the options between working in the UK and in Spain (where he's originally from). Inspired by other professionals (e.g., David Bonilla, Jerónimo Palacios).

## Donkey code

I've read [this article][donkey-code] by Einar W. Høst in which he introduces the concept of a 'missing domain term' with the example of a donkey being 'closely related to a horse, though not exactly the same'

## On Sabbaticals

I've read [this article][sabbaticals] about sabbaticals by Ian Malpass. In it, he explains why we need sabbaticals, how to take them, and some details about them.

Some principles:

> 1. If you think you can’t take a sabbatical, you need to take your sabbatical.
> 1. Day-to-day work pushes us to think tactically; sabbaticals push us to think strategically. Both are valuable.
> 1. Do the work to gain confidence that you can be away, and then trust that that the mechanisms you put in place are good.
> 1. Just because your team can function without you, doesn’t mean they want to.
> 1. There is rarely a good time to leave work for an extended period of time - don’t let this stop you.
> 1. Allow room for serendipity, the unexpected, and exploration.
> 1. Plan for your return before you leave, to avoid worry.
> 1. The sabbatical process doesn’t end after six weeks.
> 1. You don’t have to be unhappy or frustrated in your work to go on sabbatical.
