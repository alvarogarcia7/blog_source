# Chapter 5: Deal With Technical Debt and Slop

  * Seeing legacy as tech debt that has been acquired
  * Slop as source for sloppy code
  * Chapter about understanding the difference between slop and technical debt.

> Technical Debt is [...] used to explain compromises in implementation that save cost now,
> at a larger future cost (just like real debt). [...] technical debt is code written 
> under certain assumptions that no longer hold.

Uses a marker (`TECHDEBT`) to explain what and why has been introduced. Also
serves to find this debt later.
