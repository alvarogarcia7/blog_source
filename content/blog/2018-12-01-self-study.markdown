How the rich are motivated to earn more money\n>really rich people are often motivated to acquire more money by the thrill that comes with multiplying one’s fortune by making investments, buying up businesses\n>Those two ways of putting money to use—as a way of covering expenses or as a way of building a bigger fortune—\n>Every billionaire I’ve spoken to, and I’ve spoken to quite a number of them, is extremely excited by each additional increment of money they make\n> Do I have enough to buy this expensive thing I want? but rather Do I have as much or more than these people I’m comparing myself with?\n\n\n>feeling wealthy is about comparison with others in your reference group. So the question is not what individuals want to buy, but what they feel they must buy in order to keep up their status
