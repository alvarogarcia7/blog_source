## The Sliding Scale of Giving a Fuck

I've read [this article][the-scale-giving-fuck] by Cap Watkins where he explains that different topics have a different importance to each one of us: this topic might be very important for someone else, ergo, it makes mores sense to evaluate their option more carefully. When your importance level is not so high, you can take the other option easily.

## Haskell's Type Classes: We Can Do Better

I've read [this article][typeclasses] about the abuse of newtype classes in haskell to overcome some language limitations.

This article has helped me understand better inheritance, in the sections orphans and laws.

Also suggests that the compiler could check at compile time that the children impose more restrictive (more specific) laws than the parent, given that any children must comply with the inherited rules (liskov substitution principle)
