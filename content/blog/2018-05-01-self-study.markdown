[Research Shows a Simple Way to Increase Your Engagement at Work](https://hbr.org/2018/04/research-shows-a-simple-way-to-increase-your-engagement-at-work)

I've read this article By Michael Parke, Justin Weinhardt:

>We found that increasing your engagement and productivity at work could be as simple as making a plan for the day

They talk about two types of planning: time management and contingent planning. The latter is about considering possible disruptions or interruptions they may face and a plan to tackle them (if they happen).

They argue that the latter is less frustrating than the former based on the non-accomplished tasks in the former. That the former is less effective when facing a high level of interruptions, as compared to the latter, equally effective no matter how many interruptions.

They suggest contingent planning for the days with high expected interruptions, time planning for the rest. But always use planning, for higher output, happiness at work
