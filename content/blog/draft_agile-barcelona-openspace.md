Yesterday I attended an Agile Barcelona open space at Netmind

## Format

On arrival, attendees where welcomed by an Agile Coffee.

At 10:00, the introduction started: a warm welcome to everyone, including first-time attendees to an open space, explaining what it is, the few rules and laws and making sure everyone had fun. Some time later, the marketplace happened and everyone presented their sessions. A curious thing to see was the effect of TODO explain black hole

As the day went by, the sessions were happening. By lunch time, everyone self organized to have lunch. I had the opportunity to catch up with Jordi Falguera and Victor, TODO find surname. It was a very enjoyable conversation. It had been a long time since we didn't meet. Hello to both from here :)

On the evening, two more slots for sessions, followed by a cross-pollination session.

After that, some left and some went for a closing beer.

## Sessions

This does not cover all sessions, including the one I facilitated, but the ones I liked the most

### La formula de la cocacola

### Teaching from the back of the room


## Conclusion

These open-space events leave me full of energy, after having shared thoughts and happiness with the rest of the community.

A big thank you to the organizers (the community of Agile Barcelona), the facilitator (Andres Mumenthaler) and Netmind, for hosting the event

PS: This post is categorized as 'We were there', in reference to the awesome 'Estuvimos alli' posts that Carlos Ble (and Codesai) write about events. Also 'Notes' for the ones that Eduardo Ferro writes about events he attends
