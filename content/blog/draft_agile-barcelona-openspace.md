## Sessions

  * La formula de la cocacola
  * Teaching from the back of the room

## Feeling

These open-space events leave me full of energy, after having shared thoughts and happiness with the rest of the community.

A big thank you to the organizers (the community of Agile Barcelona), the facilitator (Andres Mumenthaler) and Netmind, for hosting the event

## Format

On arrival, attendees where welcomed by an Agile Coffee. TODO pics about that

At 10:00, the marketplace happened and everyone presented their sessions. A curious thing to see was the effect of TODO explain black hole

As the day went by, the sessions were happening. By lunch time, everyone self organized to have lunch. I had the opportunity to catch up with Jordi Falguera and Victor, TODO find surname. It was a very enjoyable conversation. It had been a long time since we didn't meet. Hello to both from here :)

On the evening, two more slots for sessions, followed by a cross-pollination session.

After that, some left and some went for a closing beer.

PS: This post is categorized as 'We were there', in reference to the awesome 'Estuvimos alli' posts that Carlos Ble (and Codesai) write about events. Also 'Notes' for the ones that Eduardo Ferro writes about events he attends
