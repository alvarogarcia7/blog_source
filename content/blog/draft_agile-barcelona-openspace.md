At 10:00, the marketplace happened and everyone presented their sessions. A curious thing to see was the effect of TODO explain black hole

As the day went by, the sessions were happening. By lunch time, everyone self organized to have lunch. I had the opportunity to catch up with Jordi Falguera and Victor, TODO find surname. It was a very enjoyable conversation. It had been a long time since we didn't meet. Hello to both from here :)
