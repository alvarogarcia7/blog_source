# Chapter 8: Bootstrap a Greenfield System

> Working on a brand new application can be a lot of fun. 
> There’s no "baggage" from legacy code, no technical debt,
> and there’s a wonderful feeling of freshness when starting
> an app from scratch.
>
> (p. 101)

> The decisions you make [...] can have a lasting impact
>
> (p. 101)

### 8.1 Overview

>When given a greenfield project [...] you have two main goals:
>   
>  * Make sure everyone involved in the project feels good about the initial direction and decisions being made
>  * Establish a location for developers to start contributing code
>
> (p. 102) 

Mention of the iteration Zero, that 

> [...] indicates that no direct business value is going 
> to be delivered initially
>
> (p. 102)

### 8.2 Understand the problem

> You do your company a disservice to build an application you don’t think needs to exist.
>
> To understand why the application should be built, find answers to these questions:
>
>   *  What business problems will this application solve?
>   *  Why is the proposed application the best solutiont o those problems?
>   *  What other solutions were considered?
>
> (p. 104)

Mentioning the importance of asking why about these problems, also, whether this decided solution is good / the best. 

### 8.3 Understand the System’s Place in the Technical Architecture

Mention of the 'technical architecture':

>  existing applications and existing infrastructure
>
> (p. 105)

### 8.4 Choose Technology

#### Using the Blessed Stack

Be prepared to heavily defend your position if you decide to not use
the blessed stack, both to yourself and others. (paraphrased from p. 107)

### Using a Different Technology

> You must answer the question “Why shouldn’t I use the blessed stack?”
>
> [...]
>
> [...] your first duty is to deliver results.
>
> (p. 108).

Also consider these factors:

  * Fitness for purpose
  * Performance
  * Developer productivity
  * Developer happiness - also called developer experience (DX)

(from p. 108)

### 8.5 Outline the Application’s Architecture

> You want your application to ooze consistency
>
> (p. 111)

> you want to establish a “culture of consistency”
>
> (p. 113)

> Each developer should be encouraged to establish a convention when 
> they first face the need to have one.
>
> (p. 113)
