## Being A Developer After 40

I've read [this article][developer-after-40] by Adrian Kosmaczewski on the required topics to be a developer at age 40 and keep enjoying it:

  * Forget The Hype
  * Choose Your Galaxy Wisely
  * Learn About Software History
  * Keep on Learning
  * Teach
  * Workplaces Suck
  * Know Your Worth
  * Send The Elevator Down
  * LLVM

He references galaxy, the big stack you are positioned (JVM, .net, PHP, etc). He makes a special mention of the LLVM

> Take conscious decisions in your life. Be aware of your actions and their effect. Do not blush or be embarrased for changing your opinions. Say “I’m sorry” when required. Listen. Do not be a hotshot. Have integrity and self-respect.

Recommends these books:

  * Dealers of Lightning by Michael A. Hiltzik
  * Revolution in the Valley by Andy Hertzfeld
  * The Cathedral and the Bazaar by Eric S. Raymond
  * The Success of Open Source by Steven Weber
  * The Old New Thing by Raymond Chen
  * The Mythical Man Month by Frederick P. Brooks Jr.
  * Peopleware by Tom DeMarco and Tim Lister
  * The Psychology of Software Programming by Gerald M. Weinberg
  * Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering by Robert L. Glass
  * The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman
  * Agile!: The Good, the Hype and the Ugly by Bertrand Meyer
  * Rework by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson
  * Geekonomics by David Rice

## Firing people

I've read [this article][firing-people] by Zach Holman on firing people at your current work, both from the perspective of the employee (fired), employer, coworker.

Also explains his personal experience of being fired from Github.

> You’ll know the difference between doing far and away your best work, and doing work that is still good, but just nominally better than what you’ve been doing. Once you catch yourself adjusting to that incremental progression… maybe it’s time to leave, to change things up

## Why I’m Ending my Github Streak after 844 Days

I've read [this article][ending-github-streak] by Karan Goel on the mechanics of following a pattern, of an activity sliced in small parts (1 problem a day or half an hour) and how this can be counterproductive sometimes.

Discusses ROI of this type of activity at the beginning of your career and later.
