# Part I: The Circle of Value

## Chapter 1: The search for value

> Value.  “what you want.”
>
> (p. 5)

On the building blocks of value or to produce value:

> Guiding. We produce value by creating teams with responsi- bility for creating value.
>
> (p. 5)

The value in guiding is not related to creating value in itself, but to help others so they can create value.

Therefore, the value of guiding depends on the value of the value-producing people

>
> (p. 5)

> Planning [...] selecting the features we need, in the order we need them.
>
> (p. 5)

> Building [...] product feature by feature
>
> (p. 5)

> Slicing [...] smallest possible value- bearing size

> (p. 5)

> Quality [...] always has a good design and that it is as nearly defect-free as possible
>
