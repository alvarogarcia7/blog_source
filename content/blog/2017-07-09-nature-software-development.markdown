# The Nature of Software development: reading breadcrumbs, quotes, thoughts

## Preface

> The Natural Way serves end users well because it delivers value to them sooner.
>
> serves the business [...] because it provides important information quickly, and because it provides the ability to adjust direction as needed.
>
> serves management [...] see what’s really going on inside the project so that when action is needed, there will be time to act. And it reduces management’s problems by making information visible [...]

# Part I: The Circle of Value

## Chapter 1: The search for value

> Value.  “what you want.”
>
> (p. 5)

On the building blocks of value or to produce value:

> Guiding. We produce value by creating teams with responsi- bility for creating value.
>
> (p. 5)

The value in guiding is not related to creating value in itself, but to help others so they can create value.

Therefore, the value of guiding depends on the value of the value-producing people

> Organizing [...] We organize around features, because features give us the ability to plan and build value most rapidly
>
> (p. 5)

> Planning [...] selecting the features we need, in the order we need them.
>
> (p. 5)

> Building [...] product feature by feature
>
> (p. 5)

> Slicing [...] smallest possible value- bearing size
>
> (p. 5)

> Quality [...] always has a good design and that it is as nearly defect-free as possible
>
> (p. 5)

## Chapter 2: Value is What we Want
## Chapter 3: Guiding Goes Better "Feature by Feature"
## Chapter 4: Organizing by Feature
## Chapter 5: Planning Feature by Feature
## Chapter 6: Building the Product, Feature by Feature
## Chapter 7: Build Features and Foundation in Parallel
## Chapter 8: Bug-Free and Well Designed
## Chapter 9: Full Circle

> 1. Value is what we want. Features deliver value. Deliver- ing features early gives us value sooner.
> 2. Managing by looking at value works better than manag- ing by dates or artifacts that don’t deliver value.
>
> 3. Planning features is easy enough to do. Estimate if you must. Selecting the work based on Yesterday’s Weather works better.
>
> 4. Building by features requires us to build a small, com- plete product, every couple of weeks. That product must always work correctly, and it must always be well designed.
>
> 5. Development must deliver real working features. The product must be well tested. Business-side people and developers contribute to testing. The product must be well designed. Developers keep the design alive all the time.
>
>[...] A commitment from the top of the business, down to the individual managers and developers [...]
