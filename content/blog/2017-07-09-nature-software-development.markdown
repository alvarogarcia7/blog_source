# Part I: The Circle of Value

## Chapter 1: The search for value

> Value.  “what you want.”
>
> (p. 5)

> Guiding. We produce value by creating teams with responsi- bility for creating value.
>
> (p. 5)

The value in guiding is not related to creating value in itself, but to help others so they can create value.

Therefore, the value of guiding depends on the value of the value-producing people
