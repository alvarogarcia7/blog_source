## [Day 3 of 7] "Badass" developer gets a RUDE awakening

I've read this email that John Sonmez sends, about being a programmer vs a language programmer. Some quotes:

>Someone who could tear apart complex, confusing puzzles and engineer elegant, reliable solutions... whether those challenges were software, hardware or "wetware."
>
> In other words, they wanted a professional problem solver who could jump in and deliver what the company needed, to meet THEIR customers' demands.

> I started looking for ways that I could add value to my employer outside of the code I wrote.

> I developed my "soft skills"â€”my ability to communicate, learn quickly, and pass my knowledge on to others.
