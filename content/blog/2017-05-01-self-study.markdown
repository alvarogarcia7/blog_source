## [Day 3 of 7] "Badass" developer gets a RUDE awakening

I've read this email that John Sonmez sends, about being a programmer vs a language programmer. Some quotes:

>Someone who could tear apart complex, confusing puzzles and engineer elegant, reliable solutions... whether those challenges were software, hardware or "wetware."
>
> In other words, they wanted a professional problem solver who could jump in and deliver what the company needed, to meet THEIR customers' demands.

> I started looking for ways that I could add value to my employer outside of the code I wrote.

> I developed my "soft skills"—my ability to communicate, learn quickly, and pass my knowledge on to others.

## Princeton’s Ad-Blocking Superweapon May Put an End to the Ad-Blocking Arms Race

## On Sabbaticals

I've read [this article][sabbaticals] about sabbaticals by Ian Malpass. In it, he explains why we need sabbaticals, how to take them, and some details about them.

Some principles:

> 1. If you think you can’t take a sabbatical, you need to take your sabbatical.
> 1. Day-to-day work pushes us to think tactically; sabbaticals push us to think strategically. Both are valuable.
> 1. Do the work to gain confidence that you can be away, and then trust that that the mechanisms you put in place are good.
> 1. Just because your team can function without you, doesn’t mean they want to.
> 1. There is rarely a good time to leave work for an extended period of time - don’t let this stop you.
> 1. Allow room for serendipity, the unexpected, and exploration.
> 1. Plan for your return before you leave, to avoid worry.
> 1. The sabbatical process doesn’t end after six weeks.
> 1. You don’t have to be unhappy or frustrated in your work to go on sabbatical.

## The principles of Clean Architecture

I've watched this video about the clean architecture (with a client's lunch and learn initiative). By Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin)

A quote:

> the plugin is vulnerable to the plugged-in system, at the source code level

> Separate the detail from the general things

## The Languages Which Almost Became CSS

I've read [this article][almost-became-css] by Zack Bloom on the origins of CSS and the languages to add representation to HTML pages / markup.

Describes the origins of these languages (e.g., RPP, PWP, CHSS, PSL, FOSI, DSSSL) and how the acceptance of CSS came to be: 

>  it was the technology which was easiest for a beginner to pick up which won, rather than those which were most powerful for an expert.

>  <cite> Zack Bloom</cite>

## You're not going to believe what I'm about to tell you

## Speak like a leader

I've watched [this TEDx Talk][tedx-speak-leader] by Simon Lancaster in which he explains the importance of rhetoric in our speech. Explains 6 techniques for achieving better communication:

  * Three breathless sentences: "Mangia Bene, Ridi Spesso, ama molto", "Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Fuhrer"
  * Three repetitive sentences
  * Three balancing statements: if we hear the statements as balanced, we imagine that the underlaying thinking is balanced
  * Metaphor
  * Exaggeration
  * Rhyme
