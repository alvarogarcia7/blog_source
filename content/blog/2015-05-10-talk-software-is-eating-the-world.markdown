title: 'Talk: Software is eating the world'
---

I've watched [this talk](http://reaktor.com/blog/erik-meijer-software-eating-world/) by Erik Meijer

## My notes
  
  * [Agile!: The Good, the Hype and the Ugly](http://www.amazon.com/Agile-The-Good-Hype-Ugly/dp/3319051547)

  * The hacker way
  	* code always wins vs manager always wins
  	* source: http://www.wired.com/2012/02/zuck-letter/
  * we're doing maths => we're building a proof
  * reinforcement learning
  	* agent is the company
  * related to "build, measure, learn" by Eric Ries ([the lean startup](http://theleanstartup.com/book))

### Feedback systems

  * Open (no) feedback system, such as timed sprinklers
  * Closed feedback system
  * Output only system

### Why everything is software

  * Examples of everything is software
  * Software is eating the world
  * Even hardware is modeled as software

### Modeling as a Finite State Machine (FSM)

  * There's memory in the feedback loop. See the [finite state machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)
  * A lesson from "World War Z": "When nine people agree on something, it's the tenth man's responsibility to disagree no matter how improbable the idea". "You don't believe your own [ideas]". There's an article [here](http://lifehacker.com/plan-more-effectively-with-the-tenth-man-rule-1689738373) and [here](http://evidencemag.com/world-war-z/), but they don't cite any official source related to this. The second one cites World War Z again, so it might be [confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias).
  * Test in production (e.g., [chaos monkey](https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy/wiki/Chaos-Monkey) from Netflix) rather than doing TDD
  * No evidence of TDD as effective, he sees it as waste
  * Move fast and break things

### About layered organizations

  * Layered architecture. Examples: OSI, Catholic Church, Army
  * Analogy: Software development as a professional team structure (also cited from Netflix)
  * Book: Creativity from Constraints: the psychology of breakthrough. Focus, constraint, creativity
  * Presentation: [Developing Expertise: Herding Racehorses, Racing Sheep](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Developing-Expertise-Dave-Thomas)
  * Analogy: Developers are like junkies, we want to be high all the time
  * Answering a new proposal: instead of "no, but" (black hat), "yes and" (blue hat). Reference to [Bossypants](http://www.amazon.com/Bossypants-Tina-Fey-ebook/dp/B0047Y0FGY) by Tina Fey
  * Your knives, your tools. "How can we make millions if we don't value our tools?"

### Conclusion

About software:

  > software will take over the world, and developers are the ones who make it happen.

About methodologies:

  > "Programming, motherfucker. Do you speak it?" ([Source](http://programming-motherfucker.com/))
