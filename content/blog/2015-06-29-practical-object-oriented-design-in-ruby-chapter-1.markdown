Two cited papers on metrics for design:

  * [A metrics suite for object oriented design][metrics-suite-for-ood-chidamber-kemerer] by Chidamber and Kemerer
  * [A validation of object-oriented design metrics as quality indicators][validation-of-ood-metrics] by Basili, Briand and Melo


 The video for the 'churn' as a measure:

  * [The Hidden Dimension Of Refactoring][the-hidden-dimension-of-refactoring] by Michael Feathers
