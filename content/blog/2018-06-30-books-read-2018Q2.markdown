### Quien se ha llevado mi queso

I've read this fable explaining the little story of two mice and two lilliputians that end up without any cheese. The story is about how they react to the lack of cheese, how they were used to finding cheese, fighting for it.

The morale of the story is about change and how to deal with change.

More about it here: https://business-book-summary.blogspot.com.es/2008/10/who-moved-my-cheese.html

> Wisdom in a Nutshell from Who Moved My Cheese?
> 
>   *  Anticipate change.
>   *  Adapt quickly.
>   *  Enjoy change.
>   *  Be ready to change quickly, again and again.
>   *  Having Cheese makes you happy.
>   *  The more important your Cheese is to you, the more you want to hold on to it.
>   *  If you do not change, you can become extinct.
>   *  Ask yourself “What would I do if I weren’t afraid?”
>   *  Smell the Cheese often so you know when it is getting old.
>   *  Movement in a new direction helps you find New Cheese.
>   *  When you move beyond your fear, you feel free.
>   *  Imagining myself enjoying New Cheese, even before I find it, leads me to it.
>   *  The quicker you let go of old cheese, the sooner you find New Cheese.
>   *  It is safer to search in the maze than remain in a cheeseless situation.
>   *  Old beliefs do not lead you to New Cheese.
>   *  When you see that you can find and enjoy New Cheese, you change course.
>   *  Noticing small changes early helps you adapt to the bigger changes that are to come.
>   *  Read the Handwriting on the Wall
>   *  Change happens. They keep moving the Cheese.
>   *  Move with the Cheese and enjoy it!

### One-minute manager

I've read this book on management, the story of a young man looking for guidance in the one-minute manager.

The gist of it is RPG: Reprimand, Praise, Goal (Setting). All of that done in one-minute increments.

In case the goal setting does not happen by your manager, it's your task to ask for it, so you can achieve your goals, rather than try to guess what your line manager is expecting from you.

The praising is an easy, cheap, straightforward way to encourage employees to keep doing what they're doing.

The reprimand is the way of delivering feedback that can help change the employee behaviour.

### Ladybird Book of Mindfulness, the (Ladybirds for Grown-Ups)

I've read this collection of (sarcastic) reflections about mindfulness, illustrated with classic British images.

### En defensa de los ociosos - An apology for idlers

I've read this book, containing three main essays plus some experiences.

The first, defending the idlers of society, explaining the benefits of doing nothing but enjoying life.

The second, exposing true love, the effects on people.

### Getting started with NoFap

I've read this book about the dangers of abusing PMO (porn, masturbation, orgasm), the downsides, how to fix it (reboot), what effects said reboot can have in your mind and body.

### Inteligencia emocional - Emotional intelligence

I've read this book by goleman on the topics that are included in the emotional intelligence.

Why it is so important to develop this kind of intelligence and how it compares to other kinds.
