title: Code Snippets Stash
---

Following a team member's recommendation, I recently started a repository to save all my useful snippets.

I've decided that the examples should be designed guided by tests or at least to have a working example exercised by tests. Also, that I should not reinvent the wheel and use as many open source libraries as possible, reducing the amount of code I have to write myself.

Ideally, every snippet should be a maven project (where applicable) and be imported as a small library, therefore being able to reuse the functionality incrementally across projects.

For the time being, I'm saving my snippets into a private repository and later I might decide to publish it for common usage.
