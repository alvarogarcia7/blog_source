# Chapter 4: Add features with ease 

### The ATDD cycle

> The basic process [...] is:
>
>  1. Understand the problem
>  1. Understand the system
>  1. Create acceptance-level tests for the feature
>  1. Plan your implementation
>  1. Repeat the cycle from the previous chapter until all your acceptance-level tests pass
>  1. Get a code review
>  1. Commit your changes
>
> (p. 45-46)

> [...] your goal is to fully understand what should be delivered and, more importantly, why.
>
> (p. 48)

This is needed both to write to right thing (according to business requirements) but
also the thing right (according to technical requirements).

### Sketch

> [...] To make a sketch, simply start making disposable changes to the code that 
> implement the feature. Go quickly, ignoring edge cases, tests, and cleanliness.
> As you sketch the solution, youâ€™ll develop a better understanding of where in 
> the code you need to make changes, and what those changes might be.

This reminds me of ['scratch refactoring'](http://xp123.com/articles/scratch-refactoring/),
a concept about refactoring (or pretending to refactor) to get better understanding from the
code.
