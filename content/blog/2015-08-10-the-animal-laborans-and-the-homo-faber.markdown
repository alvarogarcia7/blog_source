title: The Animal Laborans and the Homo Faber
---

I've found this quote very interesting from the book "The Craftsman", by Richard Sennett:

> *Animal laborans* is, as the name implies, the human being akin to a beast of burden,
> a drudge condemned to routine. Arendt enriched this image by imagining him or her absorbed
> in a task that shuts out the world, a state well exemplified by Oppenheimer's feeling that the
> atomic bomb was a "sweet" problem, or Eichmann's obsession with making the gas chambers
> efficient. In the act of making it work, nothing else matters; Animal laborans takes the work as
> end end it itself.
>
>By contrast, *Homo faber* is her image of men and women doing another kind of work, making 
> a life in common. Again Arendt enriched an inherited idea. The Lating tag Homo faber
> means simple "man as maker". [...] Homo faber is the judge of material labor and practice, not
> Animal laborans's colleague but his supertior. Thus, in her view, we human beings live in two
> dimensions, In one we make things; in this condition we are amoral, absorbed in a task. We
> also harbor another, higher way of life in which we stop producing and start discussion and
> judging together. Whereas Animal laborans is fixated in the question "How?" Homo faber
> asks "Why?"
