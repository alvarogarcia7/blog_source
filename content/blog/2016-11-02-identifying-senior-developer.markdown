title: Identifying a senior developer
---

Gathered feedback:

  * more knowledge and experience
  * pairing feels natural with them: your opinions are heard
  * calm when you have production issues
      - from "ohhhh hurry" to "we'll get through this"
  * the full vertical slice: a project end to end:
      - gathering requirements, implementation, monitoring, deploying
  * they've realized that dev is only one aspect
      - they need to be involved
  * never "this is not my idea / my job"
  * simple solutions. disregard complexity
      - hype = junior
