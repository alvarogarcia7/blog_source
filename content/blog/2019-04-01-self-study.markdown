## [8 SIMPLE STEPS TO IDENTIFY AND AVOID GROUPTHINK IN MEETINGS](https://highfive.com/blog/8-steps-to-avoid-groupthink-in-meetings)

I've read this article explaining the dangers of Group think, some solutions.

Defined in 1972 by  Irving L. Janis in a book by the same title, it's more present when the group exhibits these behaviors:

* A strong, persuasive group leader.
* A high level of group cohesion.
* Intense pressure from the outside to make a good decision

## [Startup Stock Options â€“ Why a Good Deal Has Gone Bad](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19624164)

An interesting quote:

> Valid reasons to work for a startup:
> - You are a cofounder.
> 
> - You have little experience and you are using this to break into the industry, and get experience on many different > technologies ("wear many hats").
> 
> - They are working on a very specific problem or using a specific technology that you strongly desire to work on and it's > difficult to do it anywhere else.
> 
> - You want to work a certain way (remote, on the beach, whatever) and they are willing to go this route.
> 
> Invalid reasons for working at a startup:
> 
> - Getting rich off stock options.
> 
> - Making a lot of money in salary.
> 
> - Work / life balance.
> 
> - Stability.

## [All Remote](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/)

The remote manifesto by gitlab.

  > * All-remote work promotes:
  > 
  > * Hiring and working from all over the world instead of from a central location.
  > * Flexible working hours over set working hours.
  > * Writing down and recording knowledge over verbal explanations.
  > * Written down processes over on-the-job training.
  > * Public sharing of information over need-to-know access.
  > * Opening up every document for editing by anyone over top-down control of documents.
  > * Asynchronous communication over synchronous communication.
  > * The results of work over the hours put in.
  > * Formal communication channels over informal communication channels.

Some tools to make this happen:
  * Faster internet everywhere - 100Mb/s+ cable, 5GHz Wifi, 4G cellular
  * Video call software - Google Hangouts, Zoom
  * Mobile technology - Everyone has a computer in their pocket
  * Evolution of speech-to-text conversion software - more accurate and faster than typing
  * Messaging apps - Slack, Mattermost, Zulip
  * Issue trackers - Trello, GitHub issues, GitLab issues
  * Suggestions - GitHub Pull Requests, GitLab Merge Requests
  * Static websites - GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages
  * English proficiency - More people are learning English
  * Increasing traffic congestion in cities
