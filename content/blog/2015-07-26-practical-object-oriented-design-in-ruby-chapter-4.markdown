title: 'Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby: Chapter 4'
---

We've read the fourth chapter from the Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby, by Sandi Metz.

These are the concepts and links brought up during the discussion:

  * The craftsmanship analogy, as exposed in [these tweets](https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/625089415812022272)
  * Difference between function and method
  * What vs How (also present in the GOOS)
