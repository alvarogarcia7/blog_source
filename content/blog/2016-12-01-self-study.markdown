## A Docker Fork: Talk of a Split Is Now on the Table

I've read [this article][docker-fork] by Alex Williams and Joab Jackson about the possible split in the Docker environment following Docker's and other providers' product roadmaps. Each own has their policies and priorities and they collide in this case

## An Ode to Boring: Creating Open and Stable Container World

I've read this article by Bob Wise, in which he describes the state of the Docker tool and the Docker Engine. Asks for some kind of Docker long-time support (LTS - like Ubuntu does, for example) and to create a boring environment so applications on top of the containers itself can thrive.

The difference here is that application creators want some boring infrastructure because their product is the application on top, not the container themselves. Docker's product, on the other hand, is the containers and the Engine.

## The hazards of going on autopilot

i've read [this article][danger-autopilot] by Maria Konnikova on how pilots get distracted (their minds drift off) when not stimulated.

The article introduces the idea of human-centric automation and letting the computer check what the human is doing (to tell when it is wrong), rather than the human what the computer is doing wrong.
