## 4 pillars of investment, the; Bernstein

## Candide; Voltaire

Came across this book as the source for the term 'Panglossian' or extreme optimist.

## Simple path to wealth, the; Collins

This book explains the "simple path to wealth".

The recommended asset allocation is a single stock + a single bond index fund, that captures the full global market (VTSAX + VBTLX). If you want to expand it or make it more complicated, searching for extra risk and return, you can overweight other regions/indices.

Makes explicit the importance of F-you money (fuck you money): giving personal freedom to explore whatever you're feeling like, not depending on a job.

> The market always goes up in the long term, but the ride is rocky.

Explains the importance of low fees. The author is a big proponent of bogleheads investing, directly with Vanguard.

## Lagom; Brantmark

Explains the simplicity system embedded in the Swedish/Scandinavian culture: the right amount, of relationships, friendships, food, work, relax.

In a way, it reminds me of minimalism, applied to all levels in your life.

> Lagom is a Swedish word meaning "just the right amount".

## Comment revivre par le jeune; Lützner

This book explains the process of fasting, everything included: how to start it, how to endure it, how to end it.

Suggests techniques for complete fasting, away from work, interactions. Explains how to do it for up to a week, then following medical advice for longer periods.

> Fasting is definitely not feeling hungry.

## Educación financiera avanzada desde cero; Hernández

## Pensiones públicas, la esclavitud de nuestra época; Hernández

In this book, the author explains several reasons why having a public pension fund is counterproductive for the general society:

  * They are not inherited, they end with your life
  * They are not well managed
  * They are decreasing over time
  * They are not sustainable for the long term

The book has definitely a liberal cut.

## On the shortness of life; Séneca

## Código del dinero, el; Samsó

## Más cosas sobre la bolsa; Hernández

This book explains more topics about the stock market and how to invest in it. 

There is a good review of general markets (e.g., energy, petroleum, television, finance); of strategies (i.e., short-term, mid-term, long-term)

There are many interesting insights.
