## WhatsApp Security Vulnerability

I've read [this article][whatsapp-vulnerability] by Bruce Schneier on a security defect in whatsapp, where an 'unconfirmed' message can be re-encrypted (with a new key) and resent. This is a vector for some attacks.

## The agonizing death of an astronaut

I've read [this article][monad-maybe-javaslang] by Daniel Dietrich on why the implementation of the ``Option`` in Javaslang seems to be broken but, in fact, follows the rules of the monads.

Explains why ``map`` should be used for non-changing contexts and ``flatmap`` should be used for changing it.

## We reverse engineered 16k apps, here’s what we found

I've read [this article][analysis-16k-apps] by Fallible team, in which they describe the analysis of apps. They discovered 2500 apps with key and secret on them.

> [...] whenever you hardcode any API key/token in the app, think hard if you really need to hardcode this, understand the API usage and the read/write scope of the tokens before putting it in the apps.
