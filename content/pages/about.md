Alvaro is a software developer who firmly believes in the eXtreme Programming methodology. He's embarked on a lifelong learning process and is now in a symbiotic exchange process with the [Barcelona Software Craftsmanship meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Barcelona-Software-Craftsmanship/), where he is a co-organizer.

He enjoys reading and reviewing technology books, providing feedback to the author whenever possible, to create the best experience for the final reader

Alvaro has been working in the IT industry for product companies, consulting firms and on his own since 2005 and occasionally blogs at [alvarogarcia7.github.io](https://alvarogarcia7.github.io)

I sometimes tweet under the handle [@alvarobiz](http://twitter.com/@alvarobiz)
